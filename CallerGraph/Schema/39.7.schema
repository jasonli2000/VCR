This file contains a list of General Order (ORM~O01) HL7 transmissions that have been sent to the National Card Management Directory (NCMD) by the Veteran ID Card software module.  Entries in this file are created/edited automatically by the VistA to
NCMD HL7 interface.  
 
Records in this file should not be added or edited except through the use of the Veteran ID Card software that is part of Registration. Doing so would likely cause Veteran ID Card database to become corrupted.
