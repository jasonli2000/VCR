This file contains the definitions for vocabulary subsets in the Clinical Lexicon, application definitions and user defaults (by application).  These vocabularies (defined primarily by the search filter and the index to be used while conducting searches)
may be used during look-up in lieu of the main expression file (if indicated by either the application definition or the user's preferences).
