 This file is used to record the most current version of a routine, and information about changes which have occurred in that routine in prior versions.  Routines are checked for any changes by using the XTVR UPDATE option which enters any changes noted
and updates the most current version.  There is no need for manual entry into this file.  
 
The option XTVR COMPARE is used to obtain listings of the changes recorded for the routine(s) from the most recent to earlier changes.

                DESCRIPTION:      This is a multiple field used to monitor the lines within the routine.  For the last/date time entry, all lines of the routine are present in numerical order from the top of the routine (line 1 is the first line of the
                                  routine) to the last line of the routine.  
                                   
                                  Changes to the routines are retained under the lines where the changes were made, including a copy of the original line and the revised line.  Insertions of one or more lines are included in the line entry WHICH FOLLOWS
                                  the inserted code.  All other lines which are not changed are deleted.
