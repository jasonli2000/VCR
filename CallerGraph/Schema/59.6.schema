              DESCRIPTION:        This is the number of days a standard order should last.  The first order entered for a patient uses this number to calculate a default value for the order's STOP DATE/TIME.  This number is also used if SAME STOP DATE

              DESCRIPTION:
                                  This is a flag, that if found to be YES, uses the STOP DATE/TIME from the patient's first order as a default value for the STOP DATE/TIME of all of the patient's following orders.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field allows the ward to tell the package how the default start date for orders should be calculated. The default may use the next admin time, the closest admin time, or the current time (now) as the default start
