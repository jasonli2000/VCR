This file is used to indicate that a correction for a historical problem with certain Fuji CR images should be applied when performing measurements on those images.  Entries should be added to this file to define precisely which CR Models/Software
versions need to have this correction applied.  The problem was that the Fuji CR image header stored incorrect values in the newer Imager Pixel Spacing field (0018,1164), whereas the older field (Pixel Spacing--0028,0030) still carried the correct value.  
Note that the problem could appear in Fuji CR images, or images that may be identified as coming from DeJarnette ImageShare CR devices.

                    HELP-PROMPT:      For this software version, enter YES to use the Old Pixel Spacing value (0028,0030) for distance calculations. 
                    DESCRIPTION:      This is a flag to indicate that the older Pixel Spacing field's value should be used when calculating distance measurements for this model/software version.  This corrects for a bug in the Fuji CR image header in
                                      which the incorrect values were stored in the newer field (Imager Pixel Spacing--0018,1164), whereas the older field (Pixel Spacing--0028,0030) still carried the correct value; answering YES to this prompt enables
                                      the program to prefer the older field when calculating a measurement for images acquired with the Fuji bug.
