              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code.  Enter M code that will modify the charge in X. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This allows the base charges of a rate to be adjusted for specific types of payers.

                                Once the Unit Charge is determined for a billable item, this code is executed to modify that charge.  This modified charge is what will be added to the bill.  
                                 
                                When this code is executed: - the original value of the Unit Charge will be in variable X - the modified charge to be billed should be returned in variable X Use the local namespace for any other variables needed and kill

                                          To add a $2.50 fee to the Unit Charge:   S X=X+2.5

                                  If a Rate Schedule has multiple Charge Sets for the same billable items then it may be desirable to chose the Set used most often and have it automatically added to the bills.  If one of the other Sets is needed on a 
                                  bill then it can be manually added to the bill.
