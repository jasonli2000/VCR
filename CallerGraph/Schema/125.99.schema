125.99,1      VERIFY TRANSCRIBED PROBLEMS 0;2 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      MAR 24, 1993 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES to flag transcribed entries for clinician verification. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is a toggle which determines whether the PL application will flag entries made by a non-clinical user, and allow for subsequent confirmation of the entry by a clinician.  


125.99,2      PROMPT FOR CHART COPY  0;3 SET

                                '1' FOR YES, ASK; 
                                '0' FOR NO, DON'T ASK; 
              LAST EDITED:      JUL 01, 1993 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES to be prompted to print a new copy before exiting the patient's list, if it has been updated. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a toggle which determines whether the PL application will prompt the user to print a new chartable copy of the patient's list when exiting the application or changing patients, if the current patient's list has
                                been modified.  


125.99,3      *USE CLINICAL LEXICON  0;4 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      JUN 21, 2007 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES to allow the user to search the Clinical Lexicon when adding to or editing a problem list NO will bypass the search, capturing ONLY the free text. 
              DESCRIPTION:      ***This field is marked for deletion in preparation for the Problem List Data Standardization project and will be deleted 18 months from the release of patch GMPL*2*36.*** 
                                 
                                This is a toggle which determines whether the PL application will allow the user to search the Clinical Lexicon when adding or editing a problem; if a term is selected from the CL Utility, the standardized text will be
                                displayed on the problem list, otherwise the text entered by the user to search on will be displayed.  Problems which are taken from the CLU may already be coded to ICD9, and this code is returned to the PL application if
                                available.  Duplicate problems can be screened out, and searches by problem performed when this link to the CLU exists.  
                                 
                                If this flag is set to NO, the user will be prompted for his/her free text description of the problem only, when adding or editing a problem.  No search will be performed at that time on the CLU, and no link made from the
                                problem to an entry in the CLU.  


125.99,4      DISPLAY ORDER          0;5 SET

                                'C' FOR CHRONOLOGICAL; 
                                'R' FOR REVERSE-CHRONOLOGICAL; 
              LAST EDITED:      FEB 07, 1994 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the order in which the problems should be displayed for your site, according to the date each problem was recorded. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This flag allows each site to control how the problem list is displayed, whether chronologically or reverse-chronologically by date recorded.  This ordering will be the same both onscreen and on the printed copy.  When new
                                problems are added to a patient's list, they will be added as the most recent problems, i.e. at the top of the list if reverse-chronological or at the bottom if chronological.  


125.99,6      SCREEN DUPLICATE ENTRIES 0;6 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 01, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter '1' or 'YES' and non-interactive duplicate problems will be screened. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                If YES is entered in this field duplicate problems (those having the same ICD9 code) will NOT be added to the problem list.  The primary purpose of this field in to screen entries added via the scannable encounter form.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is being added with GMP*2*3 to preclude duplicate entries from being entered on the problem list, primarily via the scannable encounter form.  This parameter does NOT impact the interactive entry of problems 
                                using the Problem List menu options.  Clinicians may continue to overide the duplicate entry warning when working the list.
