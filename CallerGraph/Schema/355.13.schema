This file contains the list of valid Standard Insurance Filing Time Frames. The time frame is the maximum amount of time from the date of service that the Insurance Company or Plan allows for submitting claims.  
 
The time frames in this file are those that may be automatically applied and therefore have a corresponding function to calculate the time frame relative to a date of service.  
 
Do NOT add, edit, or delete entries in this file.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                The standard filing time frame that applies to the insurance.  These are the maximum amount of time from the date of service that the insurance allows for submitting claims.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                These time frames will attempt to be automatically applied so the code to apply the time frame must be defined.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter Yes if the Standard Filing Time Frame requires a number to fully define the time frame. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This identifies those Standard Filing Time Frames that require a numeric value to complete the time frame.  For example: the time frame of Month(s) requires a value to identify the number of months.
