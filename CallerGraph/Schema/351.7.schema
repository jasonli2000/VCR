              DESCRIPTION:      This field is the entry point called by this report to extract the data that will be sent to the Extract Module. It is possible to enter a program (^ROUTINE), a specific label (TAG^ROUTINE) or leave it blank. When this
                                field is left blank, no code will be invoked by this report to extract the data. This option should be used to allow the data for this report to be extracted by a program invoked by another report. This is intended to be
                                used when there are two (or more) different reports that run the same program to extract their data, then only one will be responsible for running the code and extracting the data for both reports.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field will hold the routine name responsible for extracting the data for the report. It is also possible to indicate a specific label. The Data Extraction routine will then queue this routine and will store the data
                                returned (usually through the IB array) from it. When this field is NULL, the Data Extraction routine will do everything but queue a job. This resource (NULL) is used to allow that the routine of one report to retrieve and 
                                store the data for other reports.
