              DESCRIPTION:      This field holds the label of the sub-routine in XUMFR that gets called after an update by the MFS for a data type segment.

                                The default value for this field is 'POST'.  The POST sub-routine builds the new values of the entry in question (associated with the IEN) and compares them against the previous values (prior to update) to determine if any
                                values changed.  If the values have changed a MailMan notification is sent to the XUMF SERVER mail group and the group identified by MAIL GROUP of this MASTER FILE PARAMERS entry.  
                                 
                                Note: if the post-update routine calls POST^XUMFR then pre-update routine must call PRE^XUMFR.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-40 characters in length. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The column description is the identifier that names the data element that gets mapped to a FileMan field.  The RDF segment (table row definition) has a field (the 3rd sequence) that is a repeating element.  The 1st
                                  component of the element is the column description.  It is the column name in central repository master table.  
                                   
                                  (The 2nd component is the HL7 data type.  The 3rd component is the length of the field.) 
                                                                  
                                  The RDF segment defines the format of subsequent RDT segment (table row data).  The sequence of column description fields in the RDF segment maps the sequence of the corresponding data values in the RDT segment.  
                                   
                                  (The 2nd field of the RDF segment is the number of columns or data elements passed in the RDF and RDT segments.)
