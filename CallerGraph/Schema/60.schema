                DESCRIPTION:       Enter the WKLD code used to identify the accession workload for this test. This field can be also used for prep procedures, ie inoculating culture plates. This WKLD code count will appear on the date the specimen was
                                  accessioned into the laboratory.  
                                    This field functions in the same manner as the WKLD codes, except it doesn't require a completion date to be counted.  
                                   For CYTOLOGY SCREENING WORKLOAD the appropriate WKLD codes are 
                                   entered here.  

                TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                   The accession programs look to this field to determine if any accession workload should be credited for this test.

              DESCRIPTION:      HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) is a coding system that is composed of Level I codes (CPT codes), Level II codes (national codes), and Level III codes (local codes). Level I (CPT) codes are five digit numeric
                                codes that describe procedures and tests. CPT codes are developed and maintained by the AMA with annual updates. Level II (national) codes are five digit alpha numeric codes that describe pharmaceuticals, supplies,
                                procedures, tests and services. Level II codes are developed and maintained by CMS with quarterly updates. Level III (local) codes are five digit alpha numeric codes that are being phased out by the fiscal intermediaries.

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 03, 2006 
              DESCRIPTION:      If this panel test is an AMA compliant or otherwise billable panel, enter a 'Yes' in this field.  If this field is set to 'Yes' and a valid CPT code is on file, the CPT code for the panel will be sent to PCE for billing
                                purposes as a bundled panel.  
                                 
                                If this field is set to 'No', the panel will be unbundled into it's individual atomic tests and the CPT codes for those atomic tests will be sent to PCE for billing purposes.  
                                 
                                Note: This field is only functional for a panel test. This field is ignored for an atomic test.
