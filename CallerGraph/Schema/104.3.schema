This file contains the Ward Mappings for the MRSA Program Tools software. Here you will create 'Geographical Units' which consist of one or more Ward Locations (from file 42). For purposes of the MRSA Program Tools software all Ward Locations belonging
to the same Geographical unit are one - and any interward transfers between wards belonging to the same geographical unit will be ignored.
