The execute code file is used to store a variety of program instuctions that are used in various programs in the lab package.  The best way to see what they areand what they do is to sort them out by type.  This may only be of academic interest, since
these codes are rarely changed.  
 
The 'execute code' type entries have been moved from this file to the routine LRX.  All of the 'execute code' type entries will be deleted (with the exception of the ERROR TRAP entry) when version 5 of lab is released.  
 
Cross-reference description: 
 
 ^LAB("X",'SUBSCRIPT NAME')=EXECUTE CODE 
 
   Note: With the exception of the Error Trap execute code this x-ref has 
         been replaced with the program LRX.  
         Example:  X ^LAB("X","PT") is now D PT^LRX
