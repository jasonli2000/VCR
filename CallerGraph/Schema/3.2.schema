This file is pointed to by the Subtype field of the Device File.  This file may hold vendor-specific code to characterize a terminal type.  For example, escape sequences may be entered in the Open and Close Execute fields to set pitch or font.  This file
is also pointed to by the New Person File to record sign-on subtype characteristics by user.  Data is distributed with this file to support screens handling capabilities.  This data will overwrite existing data for those terminal types of the same name. 
However, terminal types for printers will not be affected since the data that is distributed is for a subset of known CRTs.  The Kernel Virgin Install distribution will seed a more complete set of terminal types including those for printers as well as
CRTs.  However, the Kernel Virgin Install should only be performed once and only on a system where there is no pre-existing Kernel.  The data in this file is cross-referenced by name and synonym.

              CROSS-REFERENCE:  3.2^B^MNEMONIC 
                                1)= S ^%ZIS(2,"B",$E(X,1,30),DA)=1
                                2)= K ^%ZIS(2,"B",$E(X,1,30),DA)
                                Since this cross-reference is also a B cross-reference, the alternate name should not be the same name as the #.01 NAME field.  If they are set the same, then a change in one could affect the cross-reference of the other.
