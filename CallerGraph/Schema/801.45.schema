This file is used by the process that generates reminder dialogs for a reminder. During this process, for each reminder finding item in a reminder definition, one or more dialog elements are created, depending on the Finding Type parameters in this file. 
The file content is distributed with the package, but may be edited by sites to reflect how the site uses PCE data.  The site can alter the pre-defined prefix and suffix text used to create sentences.  The site can also disable creation of sentences for 
specific types of resolution statuses (e.g., disable creation of education refused for an education topic because the site prefers to use Health Factors to represent refusals).  
 
The entries distributed in this file may not be deleted and new entries may not be added locally.
