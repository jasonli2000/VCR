     This print template generates a listing of all the fields in the 
     LABORATORY TEST (#60) file that have been marked for auditing.  The
     following fields are included in the print template report:
       INTERNAL ENTRY NUMBER (#.01), DATE/TIME  RECORDED (#.02), USER (#.04),
       FIELD NAME, (#1.1), OLD VALUE (#2) and NEW VALUE (#3).
     The print template will then execute SETTMP^LRJSAU60() to 
     add the cross reference entry in ^TMP("LRDATA",$J,"NEW" for any new entry 
     or for any existing entry where the change was less than two hours after 
     the initial record was created.  The report is produced by reading
     through/formatting the indexed entries found in the ^TMP("LRDATA",$J global.
