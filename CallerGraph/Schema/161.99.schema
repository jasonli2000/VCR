This file holds reject codes that are applicable to payment line items.  This file will be exported with data.  The data must not be locally modified.  
 
VistA Fee Basis has four logical files/sub-files that contain payment line items: 
 1. SERVICE PROVIDED (#162.03) multiple within the FEE BASIS PAYMENT 
    (#162) file.  
 2. TRAVEL PAYMENT DATE (#162.04) multiple within the FEE BASIS PAYMENT 
    (#162) file.  
 3. PRESCRIPTION NUMBER (#162.11) multiple within the FEE BASIS PHARMACY 
    INVOICE (#162.1) file.  
 4. FEE BASIS INVOICE (#162.5) file.  
 
Each of these four logical files has a free-text REJECT CODE field within a REJECT CODE multiple. The value stored in the REJECT CODE field is normally expected to have a matching record in the FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE file so a description of the
reject code can be displayed on appropriate outputs.  In the event the FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE file data is out-of-date and does not contain a code that is stored with a payment, a description similar to "Reject reason code not currently defined in
list" will be used as the code description until the code is added to file #161.99 by a patch.
