This file contains a superset of the DAM Cancer Status Codes for use in identifying tumor status at follow-up on the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY File (#165.5).  The extended codes (4-7) help the registrar to record more completely the overall cancer status of an
expired patient.  
 
This file comes with data, which overwrite the site's data.  It is not recommended that sites modify this file.  
 
This file is referenced directly by routine ONCOCOFA.
