              DESCRIPTION:      This is the current setting of the PFSS Charge Identifier.  Applications using PFSS must tag each charge transaction with a unique identifying number, which is stored within the application's file structure, and sent

                                To obtain a PFSS Charge Identifier the application calls $$GETCHGID^IBBAPI().  That function increments the CURRENT CHARGE ID by 1 and returns that value to the calling application.
