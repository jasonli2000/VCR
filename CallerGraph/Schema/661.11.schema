      Short Descr:  Index on Station, HCPCS, Item Master, Description, Item Num.
      Description:  Index used for listing items after a HCPCS has been selected in a PIP option. The list will be in alpha order by description but grouped by Item Master. This allows users to keep the Item Master description and just use relevant text
                    for their inventory item descriptions.  For example supose the item master description for HCPCS DL175 is 'WHEELCHAIR GLOVES' then 3 inventory items could be set up in PIP with descriptions: 'MEDIUM' 'LARGE' 'SMALL' When the user
                    enters DL175 for HCPCS then they get the following selection list: HCPCS: DL175   WHEELCHAIR GLOVES 
                     
                    Item master: WHEELCHAIR GLOVES
