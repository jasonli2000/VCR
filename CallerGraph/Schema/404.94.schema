This file defines specific scheduling report groups. Each report definition in the SCHEDULING REPORT DEFINITION (#404.92) is assoicated with a report group.  
 
The report group allows the easy display of related report definitions to the user for selection.  
 
These groups are pre-determined and must not be modified unless explicitly instructed as part of a patch or module upgrade.

              LAST EDITED:      APR 04, 1996 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field allows for a higher level classification of related reports.  
                                 
                                Currently(4/96), there is only one class avaliable, PCMM.  However, it is envisioned that other sub-modules within scheduling will use the basic Query Template Utility.  When this occurs, this field will allow the utility
                                to only allow user selection of reports available for the module accessing the utility.
