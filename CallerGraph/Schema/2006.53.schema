The entries in this table link the names of the various Unique IDentifiers that are defined in the DICOM standard to their numeric representations.  Cross-references are present to allow for an easy method of finding the name, given the numeric UID, or
the other way about.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Copy the name of this UID from the DICOM standard. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                The value of this field is the name of the UID.  (A UID is an Unique IDentifier.) Names of UIDs are defined in the DICOM standard.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the UID code. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a numeric code that uniquely identifies an object.  The code consists of an indeterminate number of integer numbers, separated by dots.  The DICOM standard defines a number of such unique
                                identifiers; vendors and other organizations may create their own unique identifiers by requesting an 'UID-root' from their national standards organization.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether or not this UID is a Meta UID. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                The value of this field is a code that specifies whether this UID is a 'normal' UID, or a Meta UID.  A Meta-UID has Sub-UIDs.
