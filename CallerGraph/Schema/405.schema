                                is also true for discharges FROM ASIH where both a discharge and a transfer occur at the same date/time.  The movement that physically occurs first (the transfer in the first example, and the discharge in the second) will
                                have a sequence number of 1 while the subsequent movement will have a sequence number of 2.  This number (divided by 100000000) will be added to the date/time of the movement to aid in cross-referencing these movements. 
                                This is intended to make code generation quicker.  [NOTE:  non- ASIH movements will have a ASIH SEQUENCE of 0]
