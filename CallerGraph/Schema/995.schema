This file holds definitions of CIRN events that occur.  When an event occurs, and entry is placed into a queue and is associated with an entry in this file.  This file will determine how the event is processed (i.e., the routine to call to process the
event and related HL7 Protocol).  
 
Since each event type is placed on it's on queue, this file also determines characteristics of the queue itself.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                If an event triggers an HL7 message to be transmitted to other stations, the event protocol that is triggered should be store in this field.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                The priority field defines the system priority that background queue is assigned.  A priority of 1 is lowest to priority 10 highest.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 30 and 600, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      When an event is put on a queue to be processed, a separate job is started in the background to process the entries on the queue.  After all entries on the queue are processed, the job can continue to monitor the queue for
                                new entries.  The hang time defines the amount of time the job stays active waiting for new entries.  If no entries are placed in the queue within the hang time, the background job stops.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                When a queue is disabled, no entries will be processed on the queue.
