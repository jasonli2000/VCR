This file should be used by the system manager to tune TaskMan to the site's specific needs.  Entries are identified by the cpu and volume set, so that parameters can be set differently for different nodes that share a single volume set, etc.  Changes to
any of the fields will automatically cause all accessible Task Managers on the system to update their local copies of the parameters.

                                The goal of this field is to reduce the number of JOB commands needed to process a site's tasks.  By keeping old submanagers around to run new tasks, new process creation is severely reduced.  Good values are 300-600 
                                seconds for VAX sites, and 10-50 for others.

              DESCRIPTION:      If there are more active processes on the system than this number, TaskMan will not create new submanagers to handle tasks.  Task processing will be left to existing submanagers until the number of processes falls back 
                                below this number.  
                                 
                                This number should be slightly lower than the Max Signons field of the Kernel Site Parameters file, so that the system manager still has room to sign on when TaskMan is using its greatest number of partitions.

                                Such a delay is necessary where the Retention Time is low and task creation cost is high. This prevents the creation of many new submanagers in quick succession from causing a perceivable delay to users.  The number should
                                be the lowest value that prevents the problem.

              LAST EDITED:      NOV 18, 1992 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field describes how TaskMan should act.  It takes over many of the 486 configuration functions handled by the Out of Order and Replacement Volume Set fields in versions 6.5 and 7.0.  
                                 
                                General Processor:  The Manager on a G type will usually send tasks back to the volume set where they were created, except that tasks that explicitly request a different volume set will be sent where they ask.  (Explicit
                                volume set requests are made by using 1) the ZTCPU input variable to the %ZTLOAD entry point, 2) the CPU (VOL SET) field of the Device file, or 3) the Queued to What Volume Set field of the Option file.)  To transfer tasks
                                TO a G type, TaskMan will use extended global references to copy the task to the destination Task and Schedule files, and will then remove the task from this side.  Submanagers started on a G type will process tasks in the
                                Partition Waiting List and the Busy Device Waiting Lists.  
                                 
                                Print Server:  On a P type, the Manager will run any task it finds unless the task explicitly requests a different volume set.  Tasks are transferred TO a P type the same as to a G type, and Submanagers behave the same.  
                                 
                                Compute Server:  The Manager will not start on a C type.  Tasks are transferred to a C type by placing the tasks in the Link Waiting List and jobbing a Submanager across to that volume set.  Submanagers started on a C type
                                will only process tasks in the Link Waiting List for their volume set.  
                                 
                                Other Non-TaskMan:  Neither the Manager nor the Submanager will run on O types.  Tasks sent from or to a O type will be rejected.  
                                 
                                Because of the field's crucial role in guiding TaskMan's behavior, the field is required.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is used by the Manager and Submanager as described above.  It is also used by the Global Support Routines to decide which volume sets are likely to have ^%ZTSCH("UPDATE") nodes that need to be killed to get the
                                Manager to update its parameters.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is holds a pointer to the TaskMan Master Box-Volume.  This is only needed if this Box-Volume is mounted on an other configuration and shares the library account with that other configuration.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field sets the time interval in seconds that the Task Manager will wait before running the "LOAD BALANCE ROUTINE". If this field in empty a value of 30 will be used.  A lower value will cause more resources to be used
                                calculating the balance. A large value will allow a node to pick-up a lot of work before balancing.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3-75 characters in length. Funtion, Extrinsic function, External routine. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field holds the name of a Function, Extrinsic function or External routine call that returns a load rating. If this field contains a value, TaskMan will use this name in preforming Load Balancing.  
                                 
                                Only use Load Balancing if you have two or more CPU's running TM that share the same %ZTSCH global.  
                                 
                                The Load Balancing function must return a value between 1 and 256.  Where: 1 represents a CPU with no capacity for any more work.  
                                       256 represents a CPU that is Idle.  
                                 
                                The only included functions are For VAX DSM it is '$$VXD' and its algorithm is: Capacity left= Available jobs - Active jobs - (4 * Computable jobs) 
                                 
                                For Cache/NT it is '$$CACHE1(constant)' its algorithm is: Capacity left= Available jobs + constant 
                                 
                                For Cache/VMS it is '$$CACHE2(@com-file,logical-name)'.  If the com-file value is set, that com-file will be run each time taskman wants to get the balance value.  The logical-name will default to "VISTA$METRIC" or us the
                                value entered.  The normal way would be to have $$CACHE2() in the field and use the two scripts.  
                                 
                                A script "GET_METRIC.COM" will set the logical "VISTA$METRIC".  This can be run by taskman or from the TM$node batch queue with the script "METRIC_SCHEDULE.COM".

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 13, 2000 
              DESCRIPTION:      This Field is used by the Sub-manager to control if the Sub-manger should set the ZTREQ variable to "@" so a task will be killed when it finishes unless the application modifies ZTREQ.  
                                 
                                Unless there is a need to save the enties in the ^%ZTSK global set this field to YES.  If you are researching task errors you should set to NO untill you have the data you need.  
                                 
                                This data will still be cleaned up by the XUTMK option.

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 13, 2000 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a number between 1 and 180, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used by the Task Manager to control the delay (hang) the manager will do during a START. This field is not used with a RESTART.  
                                 
                                The Manager Startup Delay was hard set at 60 before. After requests to change the delay it has been made a parameter.  
                                 
                                I would think that 5 to 30 would be OK. If you get errors because jobs start running before DDP/Cluster is up that use a larger number.
