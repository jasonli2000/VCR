The routing software is able to transmit image files from the VistA system where the images are stored permanently to various destinations that may receive temporary copies of images.  Files can be transmitted to these destinations using several 
protocols. Valid destinations for files that are transmitted using the MS-DOS copy protocol are stored in the Network Location table (FileMan file #2005.2).  Valid destinations for files that are transmitted using the DICOM C-Store protocol are stored in
this file.  
 
For each destination, this table contains the identifying information for the destinations, as well as the identifying information for the DICOM Gateways that are allowed to transmit images to these destinations. If multiple DICOM Gateways are allowed to
transmit images to a specific destination, this table will contain multiple entries for that destination, one for each source and destination pair.
