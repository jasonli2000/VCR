This is an Imaging file that temporarily stores image entries that have been acquired on the DICOM gateways and do not have an associated application parent report entry.  Imaging is a subscriber to the protocol entry GMRC EVSEND OR (Consults event sent
to OE/RR) and evaluates all HL7 message segments received from this protocol.  When an ORC message segment is received for a signed result (signed TIU note) then a module is called to lookup the entry in this file for possible matches and once found will 
update the image entry in the Image file with it's associated parent report and file the image pointer in the associated parent report.  The matched entry is then deleted from this file.

                                '123' FOR Consults/Requests; 
              LAST EDITED:      NOV 14, 2002 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the number of the file to which this image will be connected temporarily. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a pointer to a file.  
                                 
                                Since this field may point only to a very limited number of files, the datatype for this field is a SET OF CODES, rather than a pointer to the File of Files.  
                                 
                                Currently, the only possible value is 123 (Consults).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the internal entry number in the temporary file. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a pointer into a file.  
                                 
                                The file number of the file into which this field points is stored as the value of field FILE NUMBER.  
                                 
                                Since this value is not a "variable pointer", nor a "normal pointer", the data type of this field is NUMBER, not POINTER.

              LAST EDITED:      NOV 06, 2002 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the internal entry number of the image. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a pointer into the Image File (2005).  
                                 
                                The image that is being pointed to is usually the group-parent of the group of images that is linked to the entity in the temporary file.  
                                 
                                (When the image group consists of one single image, that image won't have a "group parent", and this field will point to the image itself.)

                    This cross-reference will be used to associate all images in these groups to their permanent "parent data file".
