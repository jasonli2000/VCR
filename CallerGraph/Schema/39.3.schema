                DESCRIPTION:      This field is used by the system to keep track of how many unknown type errors have occurred on a certain device.  If the system cannot determine if an error is hardware or software related, the system will consider it
                                  an unknown type error.  This field can be used as a basis for database searches.  (i.e.  How many unknown type errors have occurred on Device 1 on October 1, 1985?)
