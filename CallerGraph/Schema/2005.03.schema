The Imaging File (2005) has many "imaging multiples" pointing to it from other packages such as Radiology, Medicine, Surgery, Mailman and the various sub-files of Laboratory such as Surgical Pathology etc.  In order to have a method of tracing back from
the Image file to the parent file multiple, a file was developed to aid in this process, along with some additional fields in the Image file. Using these fields along with the PARENT DATA FILE, backward navigation is possible whether it be to a multiple
of a file, or a multiple of a sub-file of a file. Each image that is captured is associated with a procedure or test report.  Depending on the service collecting the image, different types of reports will be associated.  For example: 
 
  * Medical Procedures:  Endoscopy, Dermatology, Hematology, Rheumatology, etc.  
  * Anatomic Pathology:  Surgical Pathology, Cytology, Autopsy, Electron Microscopy 
  * Radiology:  Xray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound 
  * Surgery  Operation reports 
  * Text Integration Utility  Progress notes 
 
 In order to be able to display information from the associated report, references to that report are stored in the Image file. One of these references is a pointer to the Parent Report file (2005.03), which contains an entry for each package's report
file that is currently supported.

                                and for Surgical Pathology it is 63.08 (the sub-file number of Lab Data file, 63).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the global root type of the file or sub-file. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is used in the editing and deletion of image pointers in other files.  Since the Image file (2005) is pointed to by a variety of files a system had to be created to enable backward navigation. The global root data 
                                types or forms have been put into three groups:

              HELP-PROMPT:      POINTS TO ^DIC if regular file. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the parent file pointing to ^DIC( - in most cases it will also be the .001 field since it will be a parent file itself. But in the case of sub-files, like the laboratory sub-files, it will not be the .001 field,
                                but the number of the parent file. For example the Radiology entry has 74 for the .001 field and 74 for this field. However the Surgical Pathology entry has 68.03 for the .001 field, and 63 for the .04 field.
