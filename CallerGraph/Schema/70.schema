This file contains imaging information for patients.  This file is the focal point of the entire radiology/nuclear medicine module.  
 
The file has four basic sections.  They are the following: 
 
    I. General Patient demographics 
   II. Patient demographics that are imaging related 
  III. Registered exam information 
   IV. Outside films registry; where films received from other hospitals 
       are recorded into the system 
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
The data for the 'RAD/NUC MED PATIENT' file is stored under the ^RADPT global. This file is very volatile and should be journaled and translated if the operating system supports these two functions.  
 
 Input Templates 
 ---------------
The following is a list of input templates used by the package and the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template:

If any modifications to these input templates are needed for local purposes, then great care should be taken not to degrade any branching logic in the template.  Making modifications is not recommended.  
 
The following templates contain a large amount of branching and MUMPS code and as a result they are uneditable: 
 
   - RA REGISTER 
   - RA STATUS CHANGE 
   - RA EXAM EDIT

                                An inpatient may have a 'category of exam' of 'contract', 'sharing', or 'research' for its associated case number if the exam procedure is not directly related with their hospital stay.  (i.e. An inpatient who has an

                                  be used.  If both the exam and interpretation were done at this facility, code 0 should be used. If the entire exam was done outside the facility and exam data is being entered for the purposes of record-keeping only,
                                  code 2 should be used.

                                  SITE ACCESSION NUMBER is a Free Text data type between 12-16 characters in length. It is created by appending a three-character site identifier to the accession number. This field allows other applications to "look up" 
                                  an exam record based on a site specific accession number.

                                  The SITE ACCESSION NUMBER field has set the 'write' node to the caret to prohibit a user from jumping to this field within an input template with the intention of editing the data.

                                            The Study Instance UID is a unique key that associates the images to a particular study, and thus is required in messages sent to the PACS.  
                                             
                                            An Imaging API will be used to generate the Study Instance UID and the Study Instance UID will be sent in specific v2.4 HL7 event messages (when an order is registered, an exam cancelled, or when an exam
                                            reaches the Examined status).  This will allow Vista Radiology to send event transactions to a commercial PACS directly, bypassing the Vista DICOM Text Gateway.
