This file shall be used to flag clinics in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file as either billable or non-billable for Means Test Billing and Third Party Billing.  It may also be used to flag billable clinics so the Third Party auto biller will not create
bills for them.  The flagging of clinics is date-sensitive, so the ability to not bill may be turned on or off.  Please note that the default billing action IS TO BILL all clinics; thus, it is only necessary to add entries in this file for clinics where
billing is NOT desired.  
 
The routine IBEFUNC contains the function call to determine if a clinic should be not billed on a specific date.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
