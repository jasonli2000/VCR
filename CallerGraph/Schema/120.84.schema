              LAST EDITED:      JUN 26, 1991 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is configurable by the site to allow autoverification of observed or historical allergies.  


120.84,3.5    AUTOVERIFY LOGICAL OPERATOR 0;6 SET

                                '!' FOR OR; 
                                '&' FOR AND; 
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 30, 1992 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field will determine how the Autoverify Food/Drug/Other and Autoverify Observed/Historical parameters relate to each other.  OR means that the reaction will be autoverified if it meets the criteria of one of the two
                                parameters, while AND means the reaction will be autoverified only if it meets the criteria of both parameters.  If this field is left null, the OR condition will be used.  
                                 
                                For example, if you want to verify only observed drug reactions, you would set the Autoverify Food/Drug/Other parameter to AUTOVERIFY FOOD/OTHER and the Autoverify Observed/Historical to AUTOVERIFY HISTORICAL ONLY , and
                                the Autoverify Logical Operator to OR.  This means that a reaction that has a type of Food/Other OR is Historical will be autoverified, thus leaving observed drug reactions to be verified.  
                                 
                                Another example would be if you wanted to verify all observed reactions and all drug reactions whether observed or historical.  The parameters should be set accordingly:  Autoverify Food/Drug/Other to AUTOVERIFY 
                                FOOD/OTHER, Autoverify Observed/Historical to AUTOVERIFY HISTORICAL ONLY 
                                 and Autoverify Logical Operator to AND.  In this case to be autoverifed, a reaction has to have a type of Food/Other AND it must be Historical, all other reactions will need to be verified.
