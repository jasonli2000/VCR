              DESCRIPTION:      This is a multiple field that keeps track of tests being done in the instrument  It allows one to be exclusive of tests which the instrument 
                                 passes, as well as inclusive of the tests the machine passes which had 
                                 not been ordered from the test panel for the patient.  It means, for 
                                 example, if the order was glucose, sodium, and a number of other tests, 
                                 but not the entire ASTRA panel, but the laboratory chooses to run on the 
                                 ASTRA, all the tests can be included in the verified data.  To exclude 
                                 large amounts of data, for example, the Hematrak passes distribution data 
                                 about the slide that it has examined, information which may or may not be 
                                 appropriate for the laboratory to pass on to the ward.

                                  For sites using this instrument in a Universal Interface configuration, this field is used to define the instrument 'name' for a test. This 'name' is used as an identifier for the test in all messages sent to and from
                                  the instrument.  It is important that the Universal Interface PC has the name defined in this instrument's configuration exactly as it is here in the auto instrument file, including upper and lower case.  This field does
                                  NOT have to be the test name, but can be.  The name of this field should not be taken literally, it is used for both uploading and downloading, uni-directional as well as bi-directional.

                                  might be because the Download Code does not match exactly with the idenitifer on the PC for this instrument configuration.

                                  To round of the result based on other factors, or in other words - 'On the fly', you can set a variable in PARAM 1 as follows:

                DESCRIPTION:      This field should be set to 'Yes' if the test is to be downloaded to the instrument.  This might be set to 'No' in cases where the instrument always performs and reports a computed value, but it is not orderable.  
                                   
                                  If there is MUMPS code in PARAM 1, it will be executed regardless of how this field is answered.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter Yes or No.  If nothing is entered the default will be 'No'. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This field should be set to 'Yes' if you want to restrict results to only those tests that were ordered.  
                                   
                                  For example, if an electolytes panel was ordered consisting of: 
                                    Sodium 
                                    Potassium 
                                    Chloride 
                                    CO2 
                                   
                                  And the instrument running the sample also reported a BUN result, the BUN would not be reported if this field was set to 'Yes'.  
                                   
                                  To ignore results not ordered based on other factors, or in other words - 'On the fly', you can set a variable in PARAM 1 as follows: 
                                   
                                  PARAM 1: S:(CONDITION) LA7XFORM(5)=1

                LAST EDITED:      DEC 28, 1994 
                HELP-PROMPT:      Answer 'Yes' if you want to strip all space characters from the result before storing it.  This is generally done but not required. 
                DESCRIPTION:      If answered 'Yes' the result from the instrument will be changed so that it contains NO spaces, e.g.  > 3.2 would be >3.2.  If this test is set up to be converted to a comment (see field 13) the spaces will NOT be
                                  removed regardless of how you answer this field. MUMPS code in PARAM 1 will always be executed before any other transformation of the result takes place, including the stripping of spaces.  
                                   
                                  To strip spaces conditionally based on other factors, or in other words - 'On the fly', you can set a variable in PARAM 1 as follows: 
                                   
                                  PARAM 1: S:(CONDITION) LA7XFORM(6)=1

                                  Select "NO" to suppress the processing and storing of any remarks/comments associated with a test result. 
                                   
                                  If "YES" is selected then all remarks/comments associated with a test result are processed and stored.

                                  Selecting "FINAL ONLY" will only process and store remarks/comments when the associated test result has a status of C,F,U as defined in table 0085 below. This only applies to NTE segments that follow OBX segments.

                DESCRIPTION:      Used by the Lab Universal Interface software when processing HL7 messages that contain NTE (notes) segments which follow OBX (test results) segments. These NTE segments apply to the test, not to the specimen.  
                                   
                                  This field is used in conjunction with field STORE REMARKS (#18) in the CHEM TESTS multiple. If field STORE REMARKS is set to YES then the value of this field, if any, will be used as the prefix to the remarks when
