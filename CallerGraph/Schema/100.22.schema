Entries in this file with an internal number >1000 have been exported with the OE/RR package.  Everytime a new version of OE/RR is installed the entries above 1000 are removed and overwritten.  
 
If you want to use one of these exported entries, transfer the entry to a number less than 1000 and give it a new name so that it can be differentiated from exported entry.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to store sample data for this OE/RR PRINT FIELDS entry.  It should be representative of the raw data to which the VARIABLE field will be set (i.e., if ORSTDT=2910430.0700 is a possible value of the 
                                VARIABLE for the START DATE/TIME field, then the example entry for that field might be set to 2910430.0700.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the variable which will be printed for this OE/RR PRINT FIELD in each record.  If it is NOT an environmental variable (e.g., DT), then it will be SET by executing the CODE FOR SETTING VARIABLE node.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the formatting function name (e.g., NAME, or DATE). 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field names the extrinsic function, currently found in ^ORU, which is used for formatting the output of a given OE/RR PRINT FIELD (e.g., NAME^ORU, or DATE^ORU).  Enter the line tag only, omitting the routine name.

                                '0' FOR COMPILE; 
                                '1' FOR EXECUTE; 
              LAST EDITED:      MAY 29, 1996 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This field determines if the print field will be compiled or executed. 
              DESCRIPTION:      When a print field in used in a print format it is generally compiled based on the variable and the code for setting the variable.  This is the default for most print fields. 
                                 
                                For more complex print fields it is also possible to execute code directly to do the printing.  Setting this field to EXECUTE (1) will allow this functionality.  It will use the code in the field: CODE FOR SETTING VARIABLE
                                to perform its function.  
                                 
                                When this field is used there is generally just one print field for the print format being defined.  The code for this print field does all the printing/writing for the entire format.  
                                 
                                The code should check for the variable ORTEST when executing.  ORTEST is a flag that is used to test a print format, used by the Clinical Coordinator when defining print formats. e.g.: I $G(ORTEST) W !,"This is an example"
                                Q ...else do the real thing 

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Print fields that have a type of EXECUTE need to be able to respond to the print formats utilities.  The code needs to check for the existance of the variable ORTEST.  If this variable is around then the code should print
                                out an example or description of what the execute code will print, and then quit.  If ORTEST does not exist then the execute code should be allowed to continue.  
                                 
                                If the execute code prints more than one line, the appropriate checks for bottom of page and doing form feeds should be done.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 27, 1999 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Don't make an entry here, unless this is a package specific print field. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field should only have a value if this print field is for package specific code.  This would be fields like Lab Accession # or Consult Urgency.  Entries with this field set will be compared to the package value of the
                                order being printed.  If it doesn't match this print field will be skipped for that order.

              DESCRIPTION:
