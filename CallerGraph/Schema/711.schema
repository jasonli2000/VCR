The 1010EZ MAPPING File holds the mapping between each data element in the On-Line 10-10EZ Application and the VistA Patient database.  Each record in this file is uniquely identified by a Data Key which correlates exactly with a specific 10-10EZ form
question within a specific 10-10EZ section.  Each record also contains the exact VistA database location (i.e., file/sub-file/field) where the data will be stored.  
 
Local modifications to this file will cause the the 1010EZ module to malfunction and may jeopardize database integrity.

                                            on the 10-10EZ; each Section;Question identifier has been 
                                            mapped to a particular VistA database field (in most cases).
