              DESCRIPTION:      Until the List definition is Enabled, it will not be available for use from the VistARad Workstation; this allows you time to develop and/or modify list definitions without worrying about end-users accessing a 
                                fully-defined list.  Also, you can retire a list that is no longer needed by deleting this field's answer.
