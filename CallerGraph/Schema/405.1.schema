              DESCRIPTION:      This multiple contains all other movement types which this entry can follow.  For admissions and check-in lodger movements, this multiple will be blank as they can not follow anything.  The multiple will never contain a
                                discharge or a check-out lodger movement as nothing can follow those movements.  The 'Can Only Follow' syntax relates to one episode, either a lodger stay or an inpatient admission.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the movement which this one can follow. 
                DESCRIPTION:      Enter a movement type which this movement type can follow.  Admissions can not follow any movement types.  Nothing can follow a discharge.  Likewise, check-in lodgers can not follow any movement types and nothing can
                                  follow a check-out lodger movement.

                EXPLANATION:      Can't follow discharge or check-out.  Check-in and admission follow nothing.  Must be consistent with distributed movement types.
