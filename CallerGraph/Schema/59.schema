              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field points to the corresponding entry in the INSTITUTION file (#4) for this Outpatient Site entry. This field was created for two reasons: 
                                 
                                1) Avoid the creation of a new field on this file to store the NPI (National   Provider Identification) number and keep it at the institution level. The INSTITUTION file (#4) is being updated along with the introduction of
                                this new field to make sure that each entry in the OUTPATIENT SITE (#59) file has an unique corresponding entry in that file.  
                                 
                                2) Eventually replace the RELATED INSTITUTION field (#100), which has been   used in different ways by different VA Medical Centers. The NPI INSTITUTION (#101) will establish a consistent relationship between the
                                OUTPATIENT SITE (#59) and INSTITUTION (#4) files across the VA.
