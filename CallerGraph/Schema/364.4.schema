              HELP-PROMPT:      Select the 'type' of rule this is. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This flag puts the rule into a 'type' category for conflict checking.  It is also a flag that can indicate this rule needs to be executed to determine if an MRA request is valid for the MEDIGAP insurance that is next in
                                line for COB or if the claim should be directly shuttled to the MEDIGAP carrier.  
                                 
                                TYPE OF RULE = 0 (LIMIT TO FORM TYPES) is used to further limit the transmission of PROFESSIONAL (CMS-1500) or INSTITUTIONAL (UB-04) form types. If you pick one form type, no bills of the other form type will be 
                                transmitted for: a) the insurance companies you selected to include   OR b) the insurance companies not entered on the excluded list  OR c) any insurance co if all insurance companies are selected.  
                                 
                                TYPE OF RULE = 1 (LIMIT TO SOME BILL TYPES) is used to further limit the transmission of the UB-04 equivalent of bill type (111,131,etc).  These rules can be used to restrict transmissions to specific bill types or to 
                                allow all bill types except those specified (these are entered preceeded by a dash).  A 'wild card' character of X can be used to indicate that a character in that position is included (ie 11X will allow 111,112,113,etc) 
                                The rule will not allow transmission of bills matching the EDI/MRA and PROF/INST parameters and insurance co restrictions (see rule 0 above) unless they match the allowed bill types and do not match any of the excluded
                                bill types.  
                                 
                                TYPE OF RULE = 9 (LOCAL EDITS) are local edits.  If this type of rule is used, the code entered for the edit must return a truth value of 1 if the bill should be transmitted or 0 if the bill should not be transmitted.  The
                                variable IBIFN is the internal entry # of the bill (file 399), the IB(x) array contains the value of fields #.03,.04,.05,.07,.11 for the rule where 'x' is the field #. IBDA is the ien of the rule (file 364.4).
