                                This field holds the facility DEA number. This allows house officers who do not have their own DEA # to use a VA # for Digital Signatures.

                                The first letter for practitioners (physicians, dentists, veterinarians, pharmacies etc.) is either an "A" or "B" 
                                 
                                The second letter should be the first letter of the practitioner's last name.  Sometimes this does not match if the registrant changed their name or the DEA did not get it correct the first time.  
                                 
                                The check digit algorithm is as follows: 
                                 
                                AS1234563

                                9 + 24 = 33 
                                 
                                The last digit of the total must equal the check digit (the last digit of the DEA number).  (33#10)=$E("AS1234563",9)
