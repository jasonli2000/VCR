                DESCRIPTION:      This is the VistA package whose protocol on the DGPM MOVEMENT EVENTS driver caused this order to auto-dc, instead of the OE/RR AUTO-DC RULE.  These orders are tracked here so that they can all be displayed in the 
                                  "Auto-DC/Release Events" view, including the complete movement data in the Detailed Display.
