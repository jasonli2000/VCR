                                entry for responsible tech, then this hourly figure will be used to compute total labor cost.

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 17, 1988 
              DESCRIPTION:      Setting this field to 'YES' will cause PM work orders to be deleted from the system at close out time. Deletion of PM work orders is strongly recommended for sites that are short on disk space. The PMI will be posted to
                                the equipment history (File 6914) before the actual work order is deleted.

              LAST EDITED:      NOV 12, 1996 
              DESCRIPTION:       Intended for use at sites that allow direct entry of Engineering work orders by end-users. Since assignment of work requests to specific shops is an Engineering responsibility; 'electronic work orders' are initially 
                                directed to a 'fictitious shop' (or receiving area). Engineering should clean out a receiving area at least once a day. Electronic work orders may be transferred to working shops or disapproved.  
                                 The system will keep a permanent record of the number originally assigned to each work order. This number may always be used to look up the request, no matter how many times it's transferred. Initial requesters may edit 
                                their requests; but not after Engineering has transferred them.  
                                 'Fictitious' shops should have numbers in the range of 90 to 99, 190 to 199, 290 to 299, 390 to 399, 490 to 499, 590 to 599, 690 to 699, 790 to 799, 890 to 899, and 990 to 999 inclusive. Multi-division sites may have more
                                than one receiving area. If there is more than one receiving area AND if this field (TEMPORARY WORK ORDER SECTION) is left blank; end-users will be asked to specify the appropriate receiving area when they enter a work 
                                order.  

              SCREEN:           S DIC("S")="I Y#100>89"
              EXPLANATION:      Only shops numbered in the 90's (incl. 190's, 290's, etc.) are to be used as receiving areas.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter shop (if any) that should receive all incoming inspection W.O.s 
              DESCRIPTION:      Engineering section that receives all incoming inspection work orders.  
                                 
                                This optional field is intended for use at sites that allow incoming inspection work orders to be generated during new equipment entry. The shop for these work orders will default to the shop specified here. If this field
                                is left blank, the default work order shop will be the RESPONSIBLE SHOP for the equipment (if available) or a Receiving Area shop (similar to electronic work orders). Note that users who hold the ENPM security key can
                                select any shop for these work orders.  
                                 
                                See the Software Option 'ASK INCOMING INSPECTION W.O.' for additional information.

              LAST EDITED:      APR 20, 1991 
              DESCRIPTION:      Should be set to 'YES' if you want to print the EQUIPMENT CATEGORY at the top of your bar coded EQUIPMENT LABELs (instead of the words 'EQUIPMENT LABEL'.  Due to space limitations on label stock, only the first twenty (20)

                DESCRIPTION:      Intended for sites that must cope with more than one STATION NUMBER, perhaps as a result of consolidation or transition from one type of facility to another.  Entry of the old STATION NUMBER as an ALTERNATE STATION
                                  NUMBER will enable the Equipment Inventory and Preventive Maintenance software to recognize bar coded equipment labels that bear the old station number.  
                                   
                                  This field should also be populated at sites that support other VA facilities (cemeteries, regional offices ,etc.), especially if they choose to populate the OWNING STATION field in their Equipment File.  
                                   
                                  Sites are limited to a maximum of thirty (30) ALTERNATE STATION NUMBERS.  Only the first eight (8) entries will be accessible to the portable bar code readers, so consolidation sites should enter their satelites old 
                                  STATION NUMBER ahead of other facilities that they service. This field will not be pointed to by any other field in the Engineering Package, so sites can re-order the entries at any time.
