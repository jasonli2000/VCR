The file holds parameters related to the application exceptions in processing of HL7 Radiology messages.  
 
DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE! 
 
For designated applications, the file entries held the exceptions in processing of RAD HL7 messages. If the radiology department at the facility chooses to rebroadcast HL7 report messages to the originator of the message, that parameter is set in this
file.  
 
Different HL7 interfaces enforce different business rules. For example, Radiology may wish to apply different business rules (for example provider classification) to ''Principal Result Interpreter' (OBR-32) data.  
 
This file is where interface specific business rules will be codified.

                                cases are read/interpreted outside of VA and should not be added to the work lists on dictation workstations.
