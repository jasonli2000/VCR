This new file for Integrated Billing version 2.0 has been implemented to replace the set of codes for the STATUS (#.05) field of the INTEGRATED BILLING ACTION (#350) file.  The file holds new statuses which are introduced in v2.0, display and abbreviated
names for the status, and classification-type fields for each status which is used for processing in the Integrated Billing module.  
 
To convert to the use of this new file, it was necessary to change the field type of the STATUS field from a "set-of-codes" field to a pointer field (pointing to this file).  Thus, the internal entry numbers for the statuses in this file MUST MATCH the
codes established for the statuses in the old set-of-codes definition.  The entries in this file will be precisely set in the IB version 2.0 post initialization.  
 
ENTRIES IN THIS FILE SHOULD NOT BE EDITED OR DELETED.  IF YOU LOSE ENTRIES IN THIS FILE DUE TO SYSTEM FAILURE, THEY MUST BE RE-SET USING THE CORRECT INTERNAL ENTRY NUMBERS.  If you have any questions about re-setting entries in this file, please contact
your supporting ISC.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
