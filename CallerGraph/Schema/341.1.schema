This file is a table that allows the AR package to manage events throughout the AR package.  This file MUST NEVER be edited by sites or any users.  By editing this file, data corruption can occur and functionality in the AR package may be compromised.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

              DESCRIPTION:      The event number is how the AR package determines what type of event exists.  Since various files and functionality are driven by different types of events, the AR package uses this field to determine what action to take.  
                                 
                                This field should NEVER be edited.

                                Since the AR event type file is a table file, AR event types are found by their associated event number using this cross reference.

              LAST EDITED:      OCT 14, 1999 
              DESCRIPTION:      Events are categorized by the Category field.  This allows different event types to be associated with each other.  For example, there are many different types of payment events (Cash, Check, Credit Card, etc.) that are
                                separate events, buy these events are categorized as 'Payments'.

                                The input template field identifies an input template in file 341.  This allows the AR package to have a 'generic' enter module for entering AR events into file 341.
