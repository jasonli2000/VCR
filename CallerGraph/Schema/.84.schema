This file stores the dialog used to 'talk' to a user (error messages, help text, and other prompts.) Entry points in the ^DIALOG routine retrieve text from this file.  Variable parameters can be passed to these calls.  The parameters are inserted into
windows within the text as it is built.  The text is returned in an array.  This file and associated calls can be used by any package to pass information in arrays rather than writing to the current device.  Record numbers 1 through 10000 are reserved
for VA FileMan.

                                This field is used to tell the DIALOG routines what array to use in returning the dialogue.  It is also used for grouping the dialogue for reporting purposes.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is a pointer to the Package file.  Each entry in this file belongs to, and is distributed by, a certain package.  The Package field should be filled in for each entry on this file.

                                Cross-reference on Package file.  Used for identifying DIALOG entries by the package that owns the entry, and for populating the BUILD file during package distribution.

              LAST EDITED:      NOV 05, 1993 
              DESCRIPTION:        Some dialogue is built by inserting variable text (internal parameters) into windows in the word-processing TEXT field.  The insertable text might be, for example, File or Field names.  This field should be set to YES if 
                                any internal parameters need to be inserted into the TEXT.  If the field is not set to YES, the DIALOG routine will not go through the part of the code that stuffs the internal parameters into the text.  


.84,4         TEXT                   2;0   WORD-PROCESSING #.844   (NOWRAP)

              DESCRIPTION:      Actual text of the message.  If parameters (variable pieces of text) are to be inserted into the dialogue when the message is built, the parameter will appear as a 'window' in this TEXT field, surrounded by vertical bars.  
                                The data within the 'window' will represent a subscript of the input parameter list that is passed to BLD^DIALOG or $$EZBLD^DIALOG when building the message. This same subscript should be used as the .01 of the PARAMETER
                                field in this file to document the parameter.

                HELP-PROMPT:      This entry corresponds to the subscript of an entry in either the text or output parameter list to the BLD^DIALOG and $$EZBLD^DIALOG routine.  Answer must be 1-20 characters in length. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This multiple is used for documentation purposes only.  The entry in the .01 field of this multiple will correspond to a subscript in either the text or output parameter list, that are passed to the routines that build 
                                  dialogue messages, BLD^DIALOG and $$EZBLD^DIALOG. This routine will insert into each 'window' from the TEXT field, the corresponding entry out of the text parameter list.  For errors only, it passes any entries from the 
                                  output parameter list back to the user as entries in its output array.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field is used for documentation purposes only.  It describes the text and/or output parameter(s) that are passed to BLD^DIALOG and $$EZBLD^DIALOG. The same parameter can be used both as a text parameter (i.e.,
                                  inserted into the text when it is built), and as an output parameter (i.e., a parameter passed back in a list to the user)

              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code.  This code will be executed whenever this message is retrieved through a call to BLD^DIALOG or $$EZBLD^DIALOG. 
              DESCRIPTION:      If some special action should be taken whenever this message is built, MUMPS code can be entered here.  This code will be executed by the BLD^DIALOG or $$EZBLD^DIALOG routines, immediately after the message text has been
                                built in the output array.  For example, the code could set a special flag into a global or local variable to notify the calling routine that some extra action needed to be taken.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  At the time of executing this code 
                                 D0 = IEN for the entry in the DIALOG file 
                                 DIPI(n) = (for sequential number n) parameters incorporated in the text.

                                All other variables used in this code should use your packages namespace, and should be NEWed.
