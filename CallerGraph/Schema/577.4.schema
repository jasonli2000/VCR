This is a list of the valid subtype codes that are used along with the HL7 message type and event type to uniquely identify a message to the receiving system.  It corresponds to the applications' domain or subdomain when a domain has more than one type
of message that it will send to VDEF.  
 
For example Vitals, Allergies and Lab all send ORU-R01 messages but the contents are vastly different.  Each will use a different subtype to make the messages unique.  
 
Examples: ORU-R01-VTLS (vitals), ORU-R01-CHEM (lab chemistry)
