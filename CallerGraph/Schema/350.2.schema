This file contains the unit charges for an IB ACTION TYPE by the effective date of the charge.  The "AIVDT" cross-reference can be used to quickly ascertain the most recent charge for an action type.  
 
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Dollar Amount between 0 and 9999999, 2 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                If this charge is a fixed amount, this field contains the fixed amount.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  S %DT="EX" D ^%DT S X=Y K:Y<1 X
              DESCRIPTION:      If this charge is inactive put in the inactive date.  If the charge is not to be used the inactive date should equal the active date.  If the charge was effective for a time period but that charge no longer is valid then
                                enter the date that this is inactive.  No entry is necessary in this field if a more recent active date is added for an IB ACTION TYPE.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  S:X["$" X=$P(X,"$",2) K:X'?.N.1".".2N!(X>9999999)!(X<0) X
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 13, 1991 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Dollar Amount between 0 and 9999999, 2 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a fixed additional dollar amount that will be added to the basic charge after it has been computed. An example of this would be the additional charge of $200 added to HCFA Ambulatory Surgery rate groups for
                                inter-ocular lens implants.  


350.2,10      UNIT CHARGE LOGIC      10;E1,245 MUMPS

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>245 X D:$D(X) ^DIM
              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                If this charge is not fixed (ie an exact cost) the field contains the logic to calculate the cost per unit.  It may need to use the logic in the IB transaction type file to find this cost.  


350.2,20      ADDITIONAL AMOUNT LOGIC 20;E1,245 MUMPS

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>245 X D:$D(X) ^DIM
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 13, 2010 
              HELP-PROMPT:      M code to determine if additional amount should be added. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is M code to be executed which returns the $T value to determine if the Additional Amount (#.06) field should be added to the charge value.
