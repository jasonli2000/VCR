This file is used to hold information to create data for the physical movements (transfers and discharges) for inpatients on the date that a site chooses to begin using DSS.  Data is entered into this file by a background job which identifies all
patients who were in the facility on the selected date.  Then these entries are moved, by another background job, to the PHYSICAL MOVEMENT EXTRACT file (#727.808) to be transferred to the DSS package.  Once the transfer to the PHYSICAL MOVEMENT EXTRACT
file (#727.808) is complete, data is purged from this file, and it becomes inactive.  
  
Data elements in this file should never be entered, edited, or deleted through the VA FileMan.
