This file contains information about all KIDS build HFS files that were processed by the VFDVXPD utility.  This utility reads through the KIDS HFS files for both patch description and the installable kids files.  It gleams data from those files and
enters that information in this file.  
 
From this file, using the processing ID, you can see which patches were processed as one group.  
 
The Include and Multiple Builds tell you whether or not this patch was part of a multi-build distribution.  If so, Include tells you the name of the primary KIDS build.  
 
The comment word processing fields should only have synopsis of the necessary steps required for that kids build.  These two fields are intended to provide a quick installation check list for when the patch(es) are actually installed without the
installer having to go back to the patch description or installation guide.  However, if those instructions are detailed, then the comments in this file should be something like, Please refer to patch description or installation guide.  It is not
designed to just copy paste all that verbiage.  It should be a synopsis of the necessary steps to be performed.
