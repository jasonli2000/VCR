              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer with an identifier for the child term for this complex term pair. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This identifies the child term for a complex term pair.  A sample CHILD_ID could identify "systolic" as a child term of "blood pressure".

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer with the unit this child term must be entered in as part of this complex pair. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the unit(s) to present this child term.  A sample CHILD_UNIT_ID could identify "MILLIMETERS OF MERCURY".

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the number between 32 and 126 (0 Decimal Digits) of the ascii value for the character to be used as the delimiter per delimited values.  A sample VALUE_DELIMITER could be "47" to signify the use of the character
                                "/" as delimiter.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer with a number between 1 and 250, 0 Decimal Digits. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                The "child values" may be presented in a string of data. This field is either the last position or the last delimited piece of the data. This is where extracting of child values is to stop.
