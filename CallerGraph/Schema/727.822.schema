This file is used to hold information to create data for the treating specialty changes for inpatients on the date that a site chooses to begin using DSS.  Data is entered into this file by a background job which identifies all patients who were in the
facility on the selected date.  Then these entries are moved, by another background job, to the TREATING SPECIALTY CHANGE EXTRACT file (#727.817) to be transferred to the DSS package.  Once the transfer to the TREATING SPECIALTY CHANGE EXTRACT file
(#727.817) is complete, data is purged from this file, and it becomes inactive.  
  
Data elements in this file should never be entered, edited, or deleted through the VA FileMan.
