This file contains data used to generate notifications.  Packages determine if a notification should be sent then send the patient ID and notification ID (IEN in this file) to order entry routines.  Based on the notification IEN, data from this file is
used to generate the notification and help determine its recipients.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter your station number, followed by 01 to 99. For example, 66001. Numbers 1-9999 are reserved for National notifications only. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the internal entry number assigned to a notification.  Entries 1 through 9999 are reserved for National release by the OE/RR Notifications package.  
                                 
                                For local site-defined notifications, the internal entry number must be specific to your VAMC in the following format: 
                                 
                                <your station number><incremental notification number 01-99> 
                                 
                                For example, if your site is number 456, your first locally created notification would be 45601.                         

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                This field is used by DHCP packages triggering notifications (Lab, MAS, etc) to send the correct message and parameters to OE/RR.  These numbers must not be altered in any fashion.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3-30 characters in length. Enter the name of the notification.  The name should match the entry in the MESSAGE TEXT field as closely as possible. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the name of the notification.  It should match the text in the MESSAGE TEXT field as closely as possible (it may be an abbreviated version of the entry in MESSAGE TEXT.)  This field is displayed to users when

              HELP-PROMPT:      Always enter "OR" in this field.  This field is used to create the XQAID field passed to the XQALERT entry points.  It will typically be the Package ID.  
              DESCRIPTION:      This entry should always be "OR" to indicate the alert (notification) is processed by OE/RR.  "OR" is stuffed via a trigger x-ref in field .01.  This Package ID will have ";DFN;NIEN" concatenated to the end of it, to make
                                the XQAID variable which is used by the XQALERT routine to provide a unique cross-reference.  The order entry notification system will check the New person file to determine if this message is already pending for the user. 
                                If it already exists, the user will not receive a second message.  
                                 
                                DFN is the Patient File internal entry number.  NIEN is the Notification File internal entry number.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3-51 characters in length.  This entry is used as the actual text of the notification (MESSAGE TYPE = 'NOT') or the default text (MESSAGE TEXT = 'PKG'). 
              DESCRIPTION:      This text will be appended to the Patient last name and last 4 characters of the social security number to create the order notification text.  (e.g., SMITH (4356): Unsigned orders. - Where "Unsigned orders." is the 
                                content of MESSAGE TEXT.)  Text entered into this field is the default text for notifications where the text message usually comes from the package (MESSAGE TYPE = PKG).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Messages can be provided by the NOTIFICATION file where they are defined with the notification 'NOT' or they can be variable messages supplied by the package 'PKG' when the notification is triggered. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                MESSAGE TYPE field is used as a flag to determine where the message text originates.  If from the NOTIFICATION file, MESSAGE TYPE is 'NOT.'  If the message comes from the package, MESSAGE TYPE is 'PKG.'

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'I' if the user is to take no follow-up action for this notification.  Enter 'R' if the user is to take a follow-up action after viewing this notification (e.g. Sign an unsigned order.) 
              DESCRIPTION:      This a mandatory flag used to regulate processing in XQALERT processing.  The flag is set to I to indicate the notification is for INFORMATION ONLY - no follow-up action is to be taken.  'I' notifications are deleted as
                                each user reviews them.  'R' notifications have a follow-up action associated with them.  The user will be taken to another routine or option when they select a notification with ACTION FLAG = R and a follow-up
                                routine/option is defined.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-8 characters in length.  This should be the tag to be concatenated with the ROUTINE NAME (.07) field.  It is the entry point for follow-up action in that routine. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is an optional field used to create the XQAROU variable to be used by the XQALERT routine.  This field represents the TAG in tag^routine.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is an optional variable identifying a routine or tag(field .06)^routine used to create XQAROU for processing by XQALERT.

              HELP-PROMPT:      This field is for future enhancements.  It is currently (5/92) unused. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is an optional field used to create the variable XQAOPT for use by XQALERT.  It should indicate a non-menu type option on the user's primary or secondary menu, not on the Common menu.  The phantom jump is used to
                                navigate to the destination option and will check pathway restrictions in doing so.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the follow-up code correspond to the notification's follow-up action.  If unsure, leave blank. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the type of follow-up action to be taken.  It is used by the application managing the follow-up action  (e.g. GUI interface) to initiate the proper follow-up action separate from the underlying data 
                                base and application layers.  Example follow-up types include: report, e/s, flag.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is basically a flag for the environment (e.g. GUI - Delphi) handling notification follow-up to initiate the appropriate action.  For example if the type was report, the data returned in the API call would be 
                                stuffed into a generic text box for display; whereas if the type was flag, the follow-up action would be to find and display all flagged orders for the patient and allow unflagging.
