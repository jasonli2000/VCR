This file holds one record for each "device" in use. For example, if there is a consolidated site with a RAID in place A, a RAID in place B, and an archive in place B, there would be 3 entries in the table.  
 
Each storage provider has a type, as well as fields such as Archive, Primary (i.e. "RAID"), etc. These will be used to determine whether a particular configuration is valid at configuration and runtime.

              DESCRIPTION:      Type of storage provider. Examples of types could include: 
                                 RAID 
                                 Jukebox

                                '0' FOR No; 
                                '1' FOR Yes; 
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 04, 2011 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter Active status. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Since many data records may be linked to a storage provider, it is not safe to delete them. However, the storage provider can be deactivated (logically deleted) by setting this flag to false ("0"), so that it won't be
                                available to map to retention policies, etc.

                                '1' FOR Yes; 
              LAST EDITED:      NOV 16, 2011 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter archive flag. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates whether the storage provider can act as an archive (true: "1").  
                                 This flag is NOT mutually exclusive with PRIMARY STORAGE field (#2006.917,5). A 
                                 single storage provider (such as a grid system) could act as both a RAID-like 
                                 primary storage provider and an archive.

                                '0' FOR No; 
                                '1' FOR Yes; 
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 04, 2011 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter primary storage flag. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates whether the storage provider can act as RAID-like primary storage (true: "1").  
                                 This flag is NOT mutually exclusive with ARCHIVE field (#2006.917,4). A single 
                                 storage provider (such as a grid system) could act as both a RAID-like primary 
                                 storage provider and an archive.

                                '1' FOR Yes; 
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 12, 2011 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter writable flag. 
              DESCRIPTION:      If a storage provider is still available for read operations, but should not be written to, this flag can be set to false ("0").  Note that this sits at a level higher than a specific share. Existing mechanisms to take a
                                particular share offline, while leaving the others available for write, will still work.
