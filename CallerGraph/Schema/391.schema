              DESCRIPTION:      If, when editing data for patients of this type, you want users to be able edit data about a patient's ineligibility for care, respond yes here.  If you respond no, the data will display on the screen, but will not be

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This data has been placed on the E10 node.  Because FM does not allow more than 100 pieces on a node, it must be kept on a separate node.  The registration code will have to check if screen number is 10 or greater and
                                check the E10 node rather than the E node.

              HELP-PROMPT:      If you want users to be able to edit the missing data for patients of this type, answer yes. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                If, for patients of the specified patient type, you want users to be able to edit data about missing veterans, answer yes.  If you respond no, the user will see the screen, but will not be able to edit the missing data.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Because FM will not allow more than 100 pieces on a node, editable items on screen 10 or greater had to be moved to the new E10 node.  The fields were numbered so that the field number was equal to screen#_item# and the 
                                piece position on the node was equal to the field number.  Because the missing data is on screen 10, it is not possible to put it on the same node (because there can not be more than 100 pieces).  Registration will need to
                                check to see if the screen is 10 or greater and, if so, look at this new node.
