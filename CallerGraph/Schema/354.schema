DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.  
 
Under normal operation it is not necessary to edit the fields in this file directly.  The option Manually Change Copay Exemption (Hardships) can be used to update and correct this entry by creating a new exemption.  If many patient records have problems
the option Print/Verify Patient Exemption Status can be used to correct the entries.  
 
The data in this file is updated each time a new (current) exemption is created for a patient.  Exemptions are automatically created when changes in patient information change the exemption status or when an expired (older than 1 year) exemption is
encountered when determining the exemption status for pharmacy.  
 
This file will contain specific information related to billing about individual patients.  Current Status of the Medication Copayment Exemption will be kept in this file.  Conceptually this is different than the BILLING EXEMPTIONS File which maintains
the audit log and historical data related to billing exemptions.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
