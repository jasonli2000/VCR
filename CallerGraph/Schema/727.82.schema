This file is used to hold information to create data for the inpatient population on the date that a site chooses to begin using DSS.  Data is entered into this file by a background job which identifies all patients who were in the facility on the
selected date.  Then these entries are moved, by another background job, to the ADMISSION EXTRACT file (#727.802) to be transferred to the DSS package.  Once the transfer to the ADMISSION EXTRACT file (#727.802) is complete, data is purged from this
file, and it becomes inactive.  
 
Data elements in this file should never be entered, edited, or deleted through the VA FileMan.
