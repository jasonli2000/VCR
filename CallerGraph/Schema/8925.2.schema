This file buffers uploaded ASCII reports during the upload process, until they can be successfully routed to their respective destinations within DHCP.  It will support the development of tools for responding to error messages (e.g., the correction of
errors experienced during routing/filing) by the appropriate users, so as to avoid the necessity of making all edits on the client system and re-initiating the upload in response to an error condition.
