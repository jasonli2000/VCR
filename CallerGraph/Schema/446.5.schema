              DESCRIPTION:      This is the file that the label will print from during a search and sort functions.  For example: If you want to print a label for all drugs in the drug file, you would enter 50 or DRUG for this field and labels will print
                                from this file.  If this field is not defined, then the label will be considered to be just free text and not associated with a file.
