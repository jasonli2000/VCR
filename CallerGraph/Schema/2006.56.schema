The entries in this table contain the information about the various studies that are recorded as tasks on the worklist for a DICOM "modality".  The top-level information in this table separates the activities from the various clinics at a consolidated
site; the next level contains the study information.  
 
This file contains temporary copies of information from the VistA system that live on our satellite systems for the duration of the study that produces the images, and the only reason for replicating the information onto these "DICOM Gateway Stations" is
that we want to be able to allow the acquisition of images and the presentation of "worklist information" to continue, even while the VistA system is down, or when the DDP connection between our Gateways and the VistA system is not operating. 
 
Information is copied from VistA to DICOM Gateway when an HL7 message is processed that announces the "exam", and removed when an HL7 message is processed that announces that the exam is carried out.
