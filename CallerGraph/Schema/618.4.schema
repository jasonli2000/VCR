              DESCRIPTION:      The ADMISSION POINTER has two parts (PART ONE~PART TWO).  Part one is the ^DGPM file's "DA" or pointer to the ADMISSION Patient Movement record.  Part two which follows the "~" is the TRANSFER or DISCHARGE pointer to the
                                ^DGPM Patient Movement record or it is the pointer to the LAST Patient Movement record.  Therefore, when the patient is initially admitted part one and part two are the same.  This piece is set automatically by the
                                package.
