This file defines all input/output devices that can be accessed from this CPU (definitions are not account-specific).  Each device is identified with a unique name.  Each is associated with a $I value which may correspond with a hardware port or, on
layered systems, a host file or directory.  If there are several devices for the same volume set and $I, one may be given sign-on system status.  Devices may also be assigned to hunt groups to share work.  This file is cross-referenced by name, $I,
volume set(CPU), and sign-on/system device.  It is also cross-referenced by hunt group, local synonym, mnemonic, subtype, and form currently mounted.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Should old files in the Print Queue Directory be deleted? 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field determines whether old HFS files associated with entries in the PRINT QUEUE JOB (#3.52) file should be deleted. It only applies to devices of the PRINT QUEUE type. For print queues, an intermediate host file is 
                                created in the PRINT_QUEUES subdirectory. 
                                 
                                Normally, these files are automatically deleted once they have been submitted to the print queue.  For those files that are not automatically deleted, there is a scheduled option that will periodically delete host files
                                that have been somehow left in existence past their usefulness.  
                                 
                                Setting this field to NO will prevent the purge option from deleting HFS files created via this device.  Setting this field to NO should only be done on a temporary basis while troubleshooting a problem involving a print
                                queue. 
                                 
                                The default value for this field is YES.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field holds the name of the CPU to which this device belongs.  This field holds the name of the CPU where the physical port resides.  On DSM-11, VAX DSM, this field may hold the name of the Volume Set.  On M/11+, this
                                field may hold the name of the Directory Set.  
                                 
                                If no name has been entered for this field, this device is assumed to be accessible from all CPUs in the network.  In other words, when this device is referenced, the device handler will operate as if this device is
                                resident on the local CPU.  
                                 
                                For example, if there is a device that uses the same $I on each CPU, one entry can be made in the Device File by leaving the 'Volume Set(CPU)' Field null.  This shortcut will work only if the same $I has been associated
                                with this device on every CPU.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field has the general type of device on the CPU.  'TRM' is the most common entry.  
                                      TRM -- Terminal devices such as most crts and printers 
                                             should be associated with a corresponding device entry 
                                             with a type of 'TRM'.  
                                      HFS -- Host File Server is only available on mumps platforms 
                                             that exists on a layered system(e.g.: VMS, UNIX, NT, etc.).  
                                             This type and the associated functionality provides 
                                             the vehicle to read and write to host level files.  
                                             Instead of directing reports to a printer, the results 
                                             could be placed into a VMS, NT or UNIX file.  This would 
                                             allow a non-mumps based statistical package or spreadsheet 
                                             to use data produced by the mumps based application by 
                                             simply extracting data from the host file.  
                                     VTRM -- Virtual Terminal Server devices are those that are associated 
                                             with a dynamically created mumps port identification($I).  
                                             A generic device entry with a device type of 'VTRM' 
                                             can be established for users who log into the system 
                                             through terminal servers.  
                                      RES -- Resources is a type used for special sequencing of tasks 
                                             that do not require a particular device.  
                                     CHAN -- Network Channels are high speed devices that use network 
                                             protocols such as TCP/IP.  
                                      OTH -- Other devices that do not fit a particular category 
                                             should be given a type of 'OTH'.  
                                       MT -- Magtape device should have a type of 'MT'.  
                                      SPL -- Spool device is a predefined allocated disk space similar 
                                             to SDP.  However, access to the spool device can be achieved 
                                             from multiple users simultaneously.  
                                      BAR -- Bar code reader.  This type identifies the device 
                                             as a barcode reader.  
                                      SDP -- Sequential Disk Processor is a predefined allocated 
                                             disk space used for sequential processing.  On DSM-11 
                                             and M/11+ systems, devices 59 thru 62 are reserved for SDP.  
                                             On MSM, the Sequential Block Processor(SBP) is essentially 
                                             the same as SDP. This has been replaced with HFS.  
                                     IMPC -- Imaging work station device(reserved for future use for 
                                             DHCP Imaging Project).  
                                     PQ   -- Print Queues.  This type of device will be used on

              LAST EDITED:      AUG 19, 2010 
              DESCRIPTION:      When this field is set to FORCED and queuing is allowed by the calling program (%ZIS["Q"), the Device Handler will return IO("Q")=1 upon device selection and the job will be queued.  That is, the user does not need to
                                enter "Q" to invoke queuing and will not be prompted with the question about wanting output queued.  If the program does not allow queuing (%ZIS'["Q"), the user will see the following message: Sorry, QUEUING is required
                                for this device.

                                Set this field to ALLOWED if queuing is possible for this device.  When this field is set to ALLOWED, the application/user will determine if queuing is desired.  Setting this field to null is the same as setting this field
                                to ALLOWED.
