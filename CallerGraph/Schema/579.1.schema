              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 6-40 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Name of the source of the request, aka Requestor.  Set up by the VISTA HL7 IRM.  
                                 
                                Identifies the logical source of a class of requests for HL7 messages. For example, all solicited requests may be thought of as coming from one logical Requestor and all unsolicited requests would then fall under the other
                                logical Requestor in the system.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no. 
              DESCRIPTION:      YES/NO flag indicating whether this Requestor is the default one.  Set up by the VISTA HL7 IRM.  The VDEF Queue Manager will use this data element if no Requestor name is passed in to determine which Request Queue to put 
                                each request on.

                                Cross-reference of Requestor entries by their Default status. Will be used by the VDEF Queue Manager program to determine which queue to put a request on if no Requestor was explicitly passed in.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 07, 2003 
              DESCRIPTION:      A pointer to an entry in File 579.2. Set up by the VISTA HL7 IRM.  The VDEF Request Processor program will use this data as the default Destination for this Requestor if no Destination is explicitly passed in or if the
                                passed in Destination is invalid.

              LAST EDITED:      SEP 26, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Pointer to the Request file (579.3) 
              DESCRIPTION:      Default Request Queue for this requestor. Set up by the VISTA HL7 IRM. Will be used by the VDEF Queue Manager program to determine which Request Queue to add the request to if no priority is explicitly passed in. The data
                                in this field is a pointer to the Request Queue file (579.3).  


579.1,.05     REQUESTOR ACTIVATION FLAG 0;5 SET (Required)

                                'A' FOR ACTIVE; 
                                'I' FOR INACTIVE; 
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 19, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter "A" for Active or "I" for Inactive. 
              DESCRIPTION:      HL7 ACTIVATION flag. Set up by the VISTA HL7 IRM to INACTIVE if no outbound  HL7 messages should be generated (for testing or any other reasons) and to ACTIVE if they should be generated. Used by the VDEF API program to
                                determine whether to queue up or reject incoming requests for this Requestor.
