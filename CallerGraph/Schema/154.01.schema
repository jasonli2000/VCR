              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3 characters in length, where the first character is alphabetic and the following two characters are numeric (greater than zero).  For unknown, enter UNK in uppercase. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This three character code describes the neurologic level of injury.  The code must be Xnn, where X is the first letter of the cord segment(cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral) and nn is the vertebral level number (01-08 for
                                cervical, 01-12 for thoracic, 01-05 for lumbar, 01-05 sacral).  For example, C01 is cervical (cord segment) and 01 (vertebral level).  For unknown NLOI, enter 'UNK' (uppercase).
