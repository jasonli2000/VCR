This file contains a complete list of the approved generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs).  The top-level domain is the last dot piece of the domain name.  
 
This file is used during domain name lookup, when a message is addressed to a remote site.  If the domain name cannot be found in the DOMAIN file 4.2, MailMan looks in this file to try to find the top-level of the domain.  If it is not found, the domain
is not valid.  
 
Authorities: 
 
gTLD  - ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, 
        www.icann.org, administers the Domain Name System and 
        is the approval authority for gTLDs.  
 
ccTLD - IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, www.iana.org, 
        administers the ccTLDs.  It employs a two-letter country code 
        list (ISO 3166-1) maintained by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency.  
 
The data in this file may not be edited or altered in any way, except for the NOTES text field, which you may edit if you wish.  If you think any entries need to be changed or added, please enter a NOIS.
