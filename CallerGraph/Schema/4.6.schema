Transmission scripts are lists of script commands that are executed by the script processor for Network Mail transmissions in order when they are invoked.  The command in a Script that invokes a transmission script is the CALL.  Therefore 'C KERNEL'
invokes a script that interfaces with the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) process using the SCP (Simple Communications Protocol).  Transmission scripts are used most often to invoke a portion of a longer script that is used in many different
domains.  It can then be used in many different domains.
