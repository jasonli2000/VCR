The entries in this file tally the activity of any automated routing that takes place on the site where this file resides. Any images that are transmitted from this file will be tallied in this file.  See also the "DICOM STATION" file, which contains
similar information, but compiled for multiple sites.  
 
The counts that are reported in this table reflect the numbers of groups of images that were transmitted to the various locations The 'Description' field further describes the counts in an entry to reflect either 'Duration' or 'Lag' time.  'Duration'
refers to the total time needed to transmit the whole group of images 'Lag' time refers to the time-span between the acquisition of the last file of a group of images, and the transmission of the first file for that group of images to the destination in
question.
