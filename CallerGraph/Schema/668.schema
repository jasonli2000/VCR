Prosthetic Suspense file used to contain information regarding pending Prosthetic requests and orders.  This file contains both Manual and CPRS Orders.  
  
When a suspense is added to Prosthetics the status is OPEN.  Once an initial action is taken on the suspense record, the status changes from OPEN to PENDING.  The status remains PENDING when additional action is taken on a suspense record.  The status is
changed to CLOSED when the process is complete and either service was performed or an item was given to the patient.  
 
There are two main types of suspense items, MANUAL and CPRS via Consult Tracking.
