This file defines the resolution statuses that should be related to a particular health factor. The resolution status can be derived for most patient findings (visit file helps determine done and historical).  In order to know the appropriate resolution
statuses for a health factor, they must be defined in this file.  
 
This file is for local use. No health factor resolution statuses are distributed in this file.

              DESCRIPTION:      A list of reminder resolution statuses by health factor is maintained for use in automatic generation of reminder dialog 
                                 
                                Dialog defaults for health factors are held in the REMINDER FINDING TYPE PARAMETER file (#801.45) for every resolution status. The automatic generation process for a health factor reminder finding will only use the dialog
                                defaults for the resolution statuses in the HEALTH FACTOR RESOLUTION file.
