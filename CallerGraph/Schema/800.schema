              LAST EDITED:      MAR 03, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the name of the MailMan group that will receive reminder management messages. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Members of the MailMan mail group pointed to by this field will receive various types of MailMan messages concerned with managing reminders.  
                                 
                                Some examples: if there is an error during reminder evaluation, this mail group will be sent a message notifying them of the error. When the reminder indexes are built, the mail group will receive the messages this process
                                generates.  
                                 
                                When a message is generated, if the user is not a member of the mail group and the mail group is private, then no members of the mail group will receive the message. Therefore, it is recommended that the mail group be
                                public.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the number of updates made during the last daily MST synchronization.

800,13        TRUNCATE EMPLOYEE SSN  TRUNCATE EMPLOYEE SSN;1 SET

                                'Y' FOR YES; 
                                'N' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      DEC 05, 2001 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'N' only if full employee SSN is required on reports. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The detailed reminders due report has the option to print the full SSN for the patients selected (see FULL SSN field). However, if a patient is an employee (fields 361 and 391 in PATIENT file) the SSN will be truncated.  
                                 
                                If a site, for their own reasons, requires the full SSN for employees to be printed on their reports then this may be done by setting the TRUNCATE EMPLOYEE SSN field to 'No'.  
                                 
                                The default value installed for this field is 'Yes'. This ensures that full employee SSNs are not printed on the report. 


800,14        EDIT HISTORY COUNT     EDIT HISTORY COUNT;1 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>999)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      DEC 18, 2001 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 999, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      The option PXRM REMINDER EDIT HISTORY is used to display the edit history of a reminder definition from newest to oldest. One of the questions it asks the user is how many entries to display. This parameter sets the
                                default number to display. The user can override this and select any number they want.  


800,15        MAXIMUM NUMBER OF INDEX ERRORS MIERR;1 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>10000000)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      DEC 17, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 10000000, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      When indexing a global, details about entries that cannot be indexed are reported in a MailMan message that uses a line for each error. If there are large numbers of errors the message can become very large.  This
                                parameter establishes the maximum number of entries to list in the MailMan message so its size does not become unwieldy.  


800,16        FORMATTED DISCLAIMER   DISCF;0   WORD-PROCESSING #800.016   (NOWRAP)

              DESCRIPTION:      This file contains two fields to store a disclaimer: DEFAULT REMINDER DISCLAIMER and SITE REMINDER DISCLAIMER. The DEFAULT REMINDER DISCLAIMER is distributed with the package. A site can create and store their own
                                disclaimer in the SITE REMINDER DISCLAIMER field. If the SITE REMINDER DISCLAIMER is defined it is used otherwise the DEFAULT REMINDER DISCLAIMER is used.  
                                 
                                The disclaimer needs to be formatted before it can be displayed so for efficiency purposes the disclaimer is formatted once and stored in this field. The formatting takes place whenever the SITE REMINDER DISCLAIMER is
                                edited or deleted.  
                                 
                                 


800,17        MAXIMUM NUMBER OF MH QUESTIONS MH;1 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>100)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 03, 2007 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 100, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      When setting up a reminder dialog element, if a mental health test has more questions then the value defined in this field the test cannot be used in a dialog element. When PXRM*2.0*6 is installed the value will be set to
                                35. This parameter can be edited using the PAR option on the Reminders Managers Menu.
