The A&SP PROCEDURE CODE file (#509850.4) contains pointers to a small subset of CPT-4 codes which pertain to Audiology and Speech Pathology.  Entries in this file are pointed to by the PROCEDURE CODE field in the A&SP CLINIC VISIT file (#509805.6).  
  
Before using the QUASAR package, the supervisor must enter cost data for each procedure code in the A&SP PROCEDURE CODE file. This can be done using the Enter Cost Information for Procedures option.  
  
This file arrives at the VAMC with data.  This file SHOULD NOT be altered through the use of VA FileMan; input should take place ONLY through the QUASAR menu options.  
  
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition SHOULD NOT be modified.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 0 for INACTIVE or 1 for ACTIVE. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The ACTIVE field contains 0 for INACTIVE or 1 for ACTIVE.  Because entries in the A&SP PROCEDURE CODE file are pointed to by the PROCEDURE CODE field in the A&SP CLINIC VISIT file, entries should not be deleted.  
                                  
                                Periodically, CPT-4 codes are inactivated by the code developers, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Director, Audiology and Speech Pathology Service (VAHQ).  Procedure codes which are not to be used are marked as
                                inactive.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Does this CODE contain modifiers? 
              DESCRIPTION:      No longer used after the installation of Quasar Version 3.0.  The MODIFIERS ALLOWED field activates or inactivates CPT-4 code modifiers (i.e., 0 for NO or 1 for YES).  CPT-4 codes for Audiology and Speech Pathology may not
                                adequately describe the scope or variety of procedures seen by audiologists and speech pathologists.  Recognizing this deficiency, modifiers have been developed for certain codes to clarify procedures or to provide codes
                                for procedures where no codes now exist.
