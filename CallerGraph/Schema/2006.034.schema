This file is necessary to manage the rich data set that is passed during the Import queue event.  It is kept in sync with the Image Background Queue file (#2006.03) through the 2006.03's field #10 QUEUE DATA ITEM.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is synchronized (DINUMed) with the original "IMPORT" queue created in the Image Background QUEUE file (#2006.03). The two files (2006.034 and 2006.03) are kept in sync by a reference in 2006.03 field QUEUE DATA
                                ITEM (#10).  This back reference is necessary in cases of requeues.  The requeue process involves deleting the originally created 2006.03 entry, preserving field #10 data, and creating a new 2006.03 Import entry.  Thus the
                                DINUM connection between the files 2006.03 and 2006.034 is otherwise broken.
