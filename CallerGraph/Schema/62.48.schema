              HELP-PROMPT:      Used to call the HL7 package with the appropriate remote system identifier. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is a pointer to the HL7 NON-DHCP APPLICATION PARAMETER file (#770).  The field is used by the Universal Interface to create an Health Level Seven message using the Vista HL7 v1.5 package.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The variable HLNDAP is often required by the HL7 package.  This is a pointer to the HL7 NON-DHCP APPLICATION PARAMETER file (#770).  This field is a pointer to that file and can be used in messaging building routines to
                                set the HLNDAP variable.

                                '1' FOR SINGLE PATIENT; 
                                '2' FOR SINGLE ORDER; 
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 31, 2001 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Select if multiple/single patients/orders should be sent in a single message. See description (??) for additional help. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Determines when building a HL7 message if message should contain only one patient/order or multiple patients/orders.  
                                 
                                Default is multiple patients per message if possible.  
                                 
                                This allows site to configure message building when communicating with a non-VA system that can not handle a message that has more than one patient in the message. It applies to both order (ORM) and result (ORU) messages.  
                                 
                                When communicating with a VA facility this field can be left blank (default) or set to 0 - MULTIPLE PATIENTS 
                                 
                                If the receiving system can only accept one patient per HL7 message then select 1 - SINGLE PATIENT. This will place multiple orders or results for multiple orders in one message but only one patient will be contained in
                                the message.  
                                 
                                If the receiving system can only accept one order per HL7 message then select 2 - SINGLE ORDER. This will place in the message one order or the results associated with one order for a single patient 
                                 
                                Note: An order in the VA is considered those tests found on one accession. What the VA considers as an accession other non-VA systems may refer to as an order.

                                         demographic (ADT) messages from VistA. Used by POC interfaces 
                                         that subscribe to patient information from VistA to maintain 
                                         the POC's patient database.  
                                 
                                   HDR - Designates interface to the VA Health Data Repository (HDR).  
                                         And those systems which subscribe to VistA Lab HL7 Result (ORU) 
                                         messages broadcast by VistA when lab results are made available  
                                         within VistA. Examples are COTS clinical decision support 
                                         systems.

                                         and other specimen collection systems. Information regarding 
                                         lab orders and specimen requirement are transmitted to an 
                                         external system which assists in the specimen collection 
                                         and updates VistA Lab with information related to the specimen 
                                         and the related order/accession.

62.48,90      REMOTE SYSTEM ID       90;0 Multiple #62.483 (Add New Entry without Asking)

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to locate the correct configuration in this file when a message is received from a remote system. Most messaging protocols contain information about the system that originated the message and the system
                                that is the destination. Since there can be several senders and receivers, this field can be used to determine the correct receiver by using a special lookup on this field. The Universal Interface utilizes this field in
                                the following manner.  
                                 
                                The VISTA Health Level Seven (HL7) package requires that every message must have four fields in the message header so that it can determine the application route for the message. Those four fields are called Sending
                                Application, Sending Facility, Receiving Application, and Receiving Facility. The HL7 software must find values for each of these fields in the message within the HL7 package files. The fields must match in the following
                                way.  
                                 For HL7 v1.5 interfaces 
                                 Sending Application = the NAME field (#.01) in  the HL7 NON-DHCP 
                                  APPLICATION PARAMETER file (#770) 
                                 Sending Facility = the NON-DHCP FACILITY NAME field (#3) in File 770 
                                 Receiving Application = the NAME field (#.01) in the HL7 APPLICATION 
                                  PARAMETER file (#771) 
                                 Receiving Facility = the DHCP STATION NUMBER field (#2) in File 770 
                                 
                                 For HL7 v1.6 interfaces 
                                 Sending Application = the NAME field (#.01) in the HL7 APPLICATION 
                                  PARAMETER file (#771) 
                                 Sending Facility = the FACILITY NAME field (#3) in File 771 
                                 Receiving Application = the NAME field (#.01) in the HL7 APPLICATION  
                                  PARAMETER file (#771) 
                                 Receiving Facility = the FACILITY NAME field (#3) in File 771 
                                 
                                For the Universal Interface, all four of those fields should be entered into this multiple field, exactly as they are entered in the HL7 fields listed above, including upper and lower case characters. No spaces should be
                                entered between the field values. An example of a Universal Interface value for this field is listed below.  LAB INTERFACEInstrument ManagerLA AUTO INST695 Where LAB INTERFACE is the NAME in File 770, Instrument Manager is 
                                the NON-DHCP FACILITY NAME in File 770, LA AUTO INST is the NAME in File 771, and 695 is the DHCP STATION NUMBER in File 770.  
                                 
                                When an HL7 message comes in, these four fields are taken out of the message, concatenated together, and a lookup is done on the "C" cross reference to find this configuration and its associated parameters. The processing
                                routine can then continue to process the data.
