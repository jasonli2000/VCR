This file has the information sent from Austin in the ACT or PRJ transactions.  These transactions inform IFCAP if the EDI package accepted or rejected the PHA transaction sent to Austin.  
   
In addition this file also has the POA status sent back from the vendor about the PHA order.  The POA status is placed into the EDI STATUS CODE 1 or 2 and EDI STATUS QUANTITY 1 or 2 fields in the ITEM multiple of file 442 for the PHA order.
