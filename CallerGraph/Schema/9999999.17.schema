This file is a table with site defined Treatment names.  These are names of treatments that are not covered in the ICD-9-CM Procedures or the CPT Procedures.  Examples may include treatments such as Ear Irrigation, or Instructions or Counseling given to
a patient for a Medical Problem.  
 
When the treatment names are associated with a patients visit, they are for clinical use and do not contribute to billing and workload because of the lack of a coded CPT or ICD-9-CM.
