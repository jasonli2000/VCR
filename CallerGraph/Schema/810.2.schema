National extract definitions were sent out with Clinical Reminders V.2.0 to support site roll-up of reporting totals to the Austin Automation Center (AAC).  The generic extract functionality supports corporate level management analysis by providing
reports that: 
 
 - summarize patient reminder compliance totals (not applicable, 
   applicable, due, not due) 
 - summarize finding total counts that reflect the most recent findings 
   resulting from reminder evaluation 
 - summarize finding total counts that reflect site activities during the 
   reporting month.  
 - list unique applicable patients included in the finding count (Patient 
   List is not sent to Austin) 
 
An extract definition may be manually run or set-up to automatically run monthly or quarterly.  The extract can be defined to only produce compliance totals, or to also include finding totals.  
 
Each extract definition identifies: 
 -  Which type of totals the extract will create: compliance, finding 
 -  What patient list(s) should be created first, second, third, , and 
    what criteria should be used to build the patient list(s).  
 -  For each patient list created when the extract is run, what reminders 
    should be run.  
 -  For each reminder run, what findings found should be used to include 
    in finding count totals, based on the reminder status for each 
    patient, and pre-defined counting groups.  
 -  Counting groups are used to define findings that may have been found 
    from reminder evaluation, as well as findings that may not be in the 
    reminder but need to be counted for utilization counts.  
 -  Counts are accumulated depending on whether the reminder status was 
    applicable, not applicable, due or not due for the patient.  
 -  Utilization counts count how many times the findings in a counting 
    group were entered during the reporting period for the patients in 
    the patient list.  
 
The extract definition also identifies the last extract reporting period run and the next reporting period to be run.  This information is used to support managing extract runs.  The next reporting period is used by the next automated run to know which
period should be run.  
 
The reporting results are stored in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (#811.3) 
 
The national extract definitions are defined in this file to support generic extract and roll-up needs by facility. The generic extract tools provide options to: 
 -  manage extract criteria 
 -  manage extract runs (manual and automated) 
 -  manage transmissions to AAC 
 -  view extract reporting results 
 -  view the list of patients making up the patient denominator 
 
When analyzing the results of an extract run, it is important to take note of the following information before drawing conclusions: 
 - list rule criteria used to create the target patient lists 
   (denominators) 
 - reminder definition used to create applicable, not applicable, due and 
   not due compliance and finding totals 
 - counting rules used to accumulate totals 
 - counting groups of findings and the type of totals accumulated (all 
   patients, applicable, due or not due patients) 
 
The following is a comparison of Reminder Due and Reminder Extract report functionality: 
 
 Reminder Due reports: 
 
   Use report criteria and pre-defined report templates with location/clinic 
   stop, provider, and team lists to build the list of patients that will be 
   used to evaluate reminders.  
   
   National Reminder Due report criteria and pre-defined report templates are 
   not nationally distributed.  
 
   The Reminder Due report evaluates reminders and provides counts for Total 
   patients, applicable patients and patients due.  
 
   The patient with a Due status can be saved in a Reminder Patient List for 
   further follow-up Patient Demographic and Health Summary reporting.  
 
   The findings in the reminder are not used to accumulate counts.  
 
   An existing Reminder Patient List can be used to identify target patients, 
   instead of report criteria and report templates.  
 
   The Reminder Due report can be created in a Summary or detailed report 
   format, and is typically queued to run in a job during off-hours.  
 
 National extract reports: 
 
   Defines complex extract criteria into one extract definition that is 
   pre-defined as a national Reminder Extract Definition.  
 
   Pre-defined national extract criteria uses findings (reminder terms), 
   independent of a reminder definition, to build one or more lists of 
   patients that are used to evaluate one or more reminders.  
 
   National extract criteria used to identify patients is similar to VA 
   External Peer Review (EPRP) performance measure reporting criteria.  
   EPRP performance measures often require a current qualifying visit and 
   an anchor visit during the previous year. Since some patients seen 
   during a reporting month do not have a prior year anchor visit, the 
   national extract's total patient counts for a given month will 
   typically be less than the Reminder Due report's total patient counts 
   for the same month.  
 
   The lists of patients used for each reporting period's national 
   extract are stored on the local system for sites to validate the 
   patient denominator counts and provide local quality of care 
   monitoring.  
 
   Compliance total counts are accumulated based on the reminder status 
   for each patient: total, applicable, not applicable, due, and not 
   due.  The extract criteria used to create the totals is stored with 
   the total counts on the local system, as well as transmitted to the 
   AAC.  
 
   Finding total counts are accumulated for pre-defined national finding groups 
   based on the findings found during reminder evaluation for the patient. The 
   finding counts are totaled into categories that reflect the reminder status 
   for each patient: total, applicable, not applicable, due and not due patient 
   counts.  The finding counts are sent to the AAC with the extract criteria 
   used to create the counts.  
 
   Utilization counts are accumulated for pre-defined national finding groups 
   that count how many times specified findings were entered during the 
   reporting period for patients for each patient denominator.  The finding 
   counts are sent to the AAC with the extract criteria used to create the 
   counts.  
 
   Each patient that had a finding count is stored on the local system for 
   follow-up patient care and validation of reporting results. The patients are 
   not sent to the AAC.  
 
   The national extract tools use Mailman links with the HL7 interface to send 
   compliance totals and finding totals for each monthly period to the AAC. AAC 
   adds the national monthly reporting to the Compliance Totals National 
   Database stored at the AAC.  
 
   The national extract reports are generated by a job. IRM Staff can help set 
   up each type of extract definition to automatically reschedule itself to run 
   monthly at each site. The extract run needs to occur prior to the tenth of 
   each month. 
 
   The sites can manually rerun an extract and/or selectively retransmit an 
   extract to AAC in the event of a failed transmission. The Extract Summary 
   reports may be used to verify compliance totals.  
 
   Parties interested in viewing the AAC Compliance Totals National Database 
   may be granted read-only access to this data.  The AAC uses the 
   national database to create Simple Authentication and Security (SAS) 
   files with read-only access.  
 
File relationships: 
 
   The extract definition uses list rules (#810.4) to build lists of patients.  
   If the extract definition is for Compliance and Finding Totals, the extract 
   definition will be defined with counting rules (#810.7). The counting rules 
   will be defined based on counting groups (#810.8). 
 
   Data from the extract is stored in the extract summary file (#810.3) and 
   patient lists are saved in the patient list file (#810.5). HL7 messages 
   containing the extract data from the extract summary (#810.3) are passed 
   to the HL7 package for transmission to the AAC. Individual patient 
   level data is not sent to Austin. However, a list of patients with 
   particular findings may be stored in the extract summary file (#810.3) 
   for validation of patients.  
 
Nationally distributed definitions are prefixed 'VA-' and cannot be modified by site.  
 
Sites should name locally created extract definitions according to their local naming convention.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the type of extract totals that will be reported by the extract.  
                                                                 
                                Compliance Totals Only are similar to Reminder Due Summary reports, with the difference being multiple patient lists are used to evaluate multiple reminders, resulting in compliance totals based on the reminder status
                                (applicable, not applicable (N/A), due, and not due).  
                                 
                                Example: PATIENT LIST 1 
                                 REMINDER 1 COMPLIANCE TOTALS for Applicable, N/A, Due, Not Due 
                                 REMINDER 2 COMPLIANCE TOTALS for Applicable, N/A, Due, Not Due

                                Compliance and Finding Totals will additionally report on totals for findings found during reminder evaluation. Counting rules indicate how to count findings defined in a counting group. Counting Groups often group patient
                                cohort findings, resolution findings and information findings in different groups. The finding counts are totaled based on the reminder's status (N/A, applicable, due, not due). 
                                 
                                Example: PATIENT LIST 1 
                                 REMINDER 1 COMPLIANCE TOTALS for Applicable, N/A, Due, Not Due

                                Example: the two national extracts that are being released with 2.0, VA-IHD QUERI and VA-MH QUERI, are being released as options (PXRM EXTRACT VA-IHD QUERI and PXRM EXTRACT VA-MH QUERI) that sites will need to schedule
                                using TaskMan. When the extract is done with processing, the extract code will determine the next run date and add that value to this field.

                DESCRIPTION:      Each extract definition has multiple extract sequences.  Each extract  sequence is associated with a list rule set.  Each list rule set is used  to create an extract patient list.  Each patient list created can be run 
                                  against a sequential set of reminders. Each reminder can have a counting  rule that determines how findings should be counted.  
                                   
                                  The extract sequence numbers determine the order in which list rule sets should be evaluated to create patient lists and the sequence the patient lists will be saved to a Reminder Patient List and referenced from the
                                  extract summary (#810.3).  
                                                                   
                                  A list rule set (#810.4) and extract patient list name are defined for each  extract sequence number. The list rule set defines the reminder terms (#810.5) which are used to identify patients to be included in the
                                  extract patient list.
