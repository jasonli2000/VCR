This file allows orders to be clustered in groups other than by package.  It is similar in structure to the OPTION File (19).  This allows display groups to be arranged in a hierarchy.  The main entry in this file should be 'ALL SERVICES'.  Other entries
should be logically subordinate to the 'ALL SERVICES' entry.
