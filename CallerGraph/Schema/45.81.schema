              DESCRIPTION:      This multiple is no longer in use and has been starred for deletion.  It will be removed in a future release of the PIMS (MAS) package.  Previously, this multiple contained the suffixes assigned to various stations or
                                facilities.  It has been replaced by the Suffix Ptr field (#.01) of the Suffix Ptr multiple (#45.813) which is a pointer to the Facility Suffix file (#45.68).  The Facility Suffix file is a table file which contains the
                                suffixes, effective date(s), and active/inactive flag(s).
