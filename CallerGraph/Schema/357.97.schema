              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 9999999999, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This number is used to store images where the form id or form type could not be determined.  The alogrythm for storing images is: 
                                   1.  If form type, form id, and page are known, and the form passed 
                                       validation, the image is stored as Xnnnnnn.tif, where X is the 
                                       workstation identifier, and the first 6 n's are the form ID and 
                                       the last n is the page number, for example, if workstation A 
                                       scanned page 1 of form id 87753 the image would be stored as 
                                       A877531.tif.  (Validated Form) 
                                 
                                   2.  If a form requires further validation before sending data to 
                                       PCE but the form id, form type, and page are known then the 
                                       image is stored as Unnnnnnn.tif, where n is described above.  
                                       (Requires Further Validation) 
                                 
                                   3.  If the form ID, form type, or page cannot be determined then 
                                       the image is saved as an Unknown form in the format of UNnnnnnn.tif 
                                       where the number nnnnnnn is determined from this counter.
