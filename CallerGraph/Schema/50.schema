This file holds the information related to each drug that can be used to fill a prescription.  It is pointed to from several other files and should be handled carefully, usually only by special individuals in the pharmacy service.  Entries are not
typically deleted, but rather made inactive by entering an inactive date.  
 
This file must be built by Pharmacy Service BEFORE going on-line.  It is common to use another centers file and edit it to match your center's unique formulary.

                                              For 5 oz. antacid, the quantity dispensed is 1, and 
                                              the conversion number is 1.  
                                              For a bottle of 100 aspirin, the quantity dispensed is 1, 
                                              and the conversion number is 100.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                The Charge Description Master (CDM) Change Control board assigns value for this field. The value should be a number between 600001-699999. 

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field was introduced as part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) project, to implement a new COTS billing system. Pharmacy application will maintain a CDM/Service Code for every dispensed item. It requires
                                that every prescription charge transaction passed to the external billing system to pass a service code. If the drug is not matched to NDF or the Service Code field in the VA PRODUCT file #50.68 is undefined, this field
                                will be prompted during DRUG ENTER/EDIT [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option. In the event the drug is matched later to a NDF entry, previously defined Service Code will be retained.
