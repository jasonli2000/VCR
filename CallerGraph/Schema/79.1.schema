ELEMENT       TITLE                 LOCATION      TYPE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file contains, for each imagaing location entry, parameters that the module uses during various stages of exam and report processing and inquiring.  The parameter switches allow the 'customizing' of the module for each location by the package
coordinator.  
 
Within an imaging division there may be a number of physical locations where a imaging procedure can be performed.  The module is designed to handle multiple locations within a division.  However, each location can only be associated with one division.  
 
These parameters are loaded into the user's partition once the module determines which division and location the user is currently associated with.  This is determined by one of two ways: 1) the device the user is using is an entry in the 'INPUT DEVICES'
sub-file for a location or 2) if (1) is not true than the module will simply ask the user what his/her current location is.  
 
Entries in this file should not be deleted.  Adding new entries is always allowed.  
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
The data for the 'IMAGING LOCATIONS' file is stored in the ^RA(79.1, global. At the present time this file is very static after day-one initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.  It should also be translated if the operating
system supports this function.  
 
 Input Templates 
 ---------------
The following is a list of input templates used by the package and the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template: 
 
                     Compiled 
 Name                Routine      Description; Option(s) 
 ----                -------     -----------------------
 RA LOCATION PARAMETERS          Used to enter/edit location parameters 
                                 that are controlled by the package 
                                 coordinator; 
                                 RA SYSLOC 
 
 RA SITE MANAGER                 Used to enter/edit location parameters 
                                 that are controlled by IRM; 
                                 RA DEVICE 
 
If any modifications to these input templates are needed for local purposes, then great care should be taken not to degrade any branching logic in the template.  
 
 Print Templates 
 ---------------
 The following is a list of print templates used by the package:

              DESCRIPTION:      This field points to the Hospital Location File, and contains the name of this location.  The Hospital Location pointed to should be a COUNT clinic, with a type of 'CLINIC', and should be a clinic that prohibits making 
                                appointments or creating appointment patterns.  The Stop Code of the clinic in file #44 should be a valid imaging stop code (i.e. an entry in file #71.5) and should match the DSS ID field #22 of the Imaging Location in
                                file #79.1.  The Institution of this clinic in file #44 should match the Rad/Nuc Med Division to which this Imaging Location is assigned.  
                                 
                                Coordination with MAS personnel is necessary to add locations to the Hospital Location file.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter an imaging type for this location. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This 'locations' parameter can contain the name of the type of imaging from the 'Imaging Type' file.  If this field is filled in, the system automatically fills in the proper imaging type on the registration record.  
                                 
                                Assigning an new imaging type (i.e. one not previously selected for any other location) implies that procedures of the new imaging type are performed under a separate service or section at your site, and separate workload
                                report is desired. For instance, at some sites Ultrasound may be done separately from Radiology, and it would be appropriate to assign the 'Ultrasound' imaging type to one or more locations.  Once the 'Ultrasound' imaging
                                type is "activated" in this way, and procedures designated as 'Ultrasound' imaging type have been registered, the system will report Ultrasound workload separately from Radiology workload.  
                                 
                                NOTE:  The 'Cardiology Studies' imaging type should NOT be assigned to a location unless nuclear cardiology studies are done under a service other than Nuclear Medicine.

                                footers, you may also need to change report header and footer set-ups to get the diagnostic codes printed exactly as you wish.)

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer 'Yes' if you want alerts to be sent to Imaging Personnel recipients for URGENT requests. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field will determine if alerts will be sent to the Imaging Personnel defined in the STAT REQUEST ALERT RECIPIENTS field.  If this field is set to 'Yes', then all the users in the STAT REQUEST ALERT RECIPIENTS field 
                                will be sent an alert for urgent requests. To use this feature, the Division parameter 'Ask Imaging Location' must be set to 'YES', and OE/RR Version 3.0 or higher must be installed.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the type of credit this location will receive for this examination. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates the type of credit this location receives for examinations.  The default is REGULAR (code 0), which means that for this imaging location both the exam and the interpretation are done at your facility.
                                If this imaging location has been set up to register exams done in another facility, with the imaging interpretation only done at this facility, enter code 1.  If exams are done in this location, but interpretation is done
                                elsewhere, enter code 3.  If both the exam and the interpretation are done elsewhere, and exams entered for this imaging location are entered only for record-keeping purposes, enter code 2.

              DESCRIPTION:      DSS ID will be used to identify the general outpatient area where an imaging exam was done.  It is used only by DSS, and only when processing outpatients. It is roughly equivalent to the "Stop Codes" previously used for
                                crediting outpatient exams.  Only entries also in the Imaging Stop Codes file #71.5 (which must be updated yearly by the Radiology/Nuclear Medicine ADPAC) are valid.

              DESCRIPTION:      This question only applies to imaging locations with an imaging type where radiopharmaceuticals are used (i.e. nuclear medicine and cardiology studies). If the facility's exam status parameters are configured to print 
                                Radiopharmaceutical dosage tickets when exams reach a specified status, and name of the printer device is entered here, then dosage tickets for nuclear medicine procedures registered in this location will print on this
