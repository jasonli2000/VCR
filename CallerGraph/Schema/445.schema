This file contains descriptive and inventory information for any entity that wants to maintain a perpetual inventory, automate their item distribution function, and automatically generate stock replenishment orders based on inventory needs.  
 
There are three types of inventory points that can be on this file: Warehouses, Primary Distribution Points (locations that are allowed to order directly from supply), or Secondary Distribution Points (locations that must order through a Primary
Distribution Point).

                                    the computer calculated that they needed 8 cases and the minimum issue quantity was 10 cases, it would bump up their quantity to order to 10.  Also, whenever another inventory point orders this item manually, the

                                  Center, to a location that will in turn distribute the supplies to an MIS Service/Section.  The Cost Accounting Report allocates the total dollar amount by MIS costing section within cost center.  The user enters MIS

              DESCRIPTION:      The only way to delete an item from your inventory file, is to set the 'DELETE ITEM WHEN INVENTORY 0' flag to 'Y'.  During the automatic generation of a suggested order, if the program encounters an item with the flag set,
                                it first makes sure that the inventory quantity on hand, the DUE-IN, and the DUE-OUT are all 0, and that the item does not exist on any of your secondary distribution points.  If it meets the criteria, then the program
                                checks this field, and if it contains a number, the program makes sure that there has been no activity for the item (i.e., usage, distribution or receiving) for at least the number of months specified in this field, before
