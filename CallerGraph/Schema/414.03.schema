In the event that an external system needs to be notified when an event of some type occurs, a publish/subscribe interface allows messages to be sent to that system when the event occurs. This file contains a list of active subscriptions, and records are
added or deleted in response to "subscribe" or "cancel" messages received from the external system. More than one type of subscription is supported.
