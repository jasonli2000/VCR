              DESCRIPTION:      This field determines how the list of Health Summary Types for the CPRS GUI report tab is to be organized (APPEND or OVERWRITE) for user selection.  There are three major classes of Health Summary types, National (remote
                                data view), user defined and system defined.  User and system Health Summary Types are defined in the Kernel Parameters file.  Append creates a single list, removing duplicates, and keeps the National Health Summary types
                                group together.  Overwrite stops building the list once a single group of Health Summary Types (User or System) is added to the list.
