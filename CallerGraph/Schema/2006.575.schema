The entries in this table describe image files that were received by the DICOM Image Gateway, and could not be matched with a patient and an ordered study.  
 
The MAGD FIX DICOM FILE and MAGD FIX MEDICINE DICOM FILE menu options are used to update the entries in this file.  The DICOM Image Gateway will poll this file for corrected entries. The cross reference used to poll this information is
^MAGD(2006.575,"AFX".  
 
The routine L^MAGDLB1 is used by the above menu options and will loop thru the following cross reference ^MAGD(2006.575,"F".  This cross reference is set by the DICOM Study Instance UID; this is a unique number assigned by modalities (imaging equipment)
and is unique by case study.  So it is possible to have over 20 entries in the file and only one unique "F" cross reference.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'No Case #', 'Bad Case #', 'PID Error' or 'Unknown' or 'Cancelled'. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a code that indicates the reason why the image file that is described in the current entry could not be matched with a patient and study.  
                                 
                                The possible values for this field are NOCASE#, PATIENT, UNKNOWN or CANCELLED.  
                                 
                                When the entry is processed the match for the Radiology entry is by case number and then by patient ID. If these entries are not provided correctly then entries are made into this file.

              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is the value that is transmitted by the modality for DICOM element 0010,0020.  Typically, the value of this field is equal to the Social Security Number of the patient for whom the study is
                                scheduled.  (Without the dashes between the number-groups.) 
                                 
                                This value is copied from the VistA Database, so that worklist queries can also be performed when the network connection (DDP) with the main Hospital Information System is not available.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the multiple sub-file that repoints to this file.  This sub-file will point to all the related images having the same study instance UID.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field creates a cross reference that is used by the DICOM Image gateway to process all images pertaining to one unique study instance UID.  
                                 This field also allow the manual correction routines to only prompt/display a single entry needing corrections and will apply the corrections made to all entries in this sub-file.
