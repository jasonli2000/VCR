 This file is used to maintain a log of the errors occurring during use of the system.  Errors are entered into this log by the error trap established for the user (by ZU or application programs) calling %ZTER when an error occurs.  The entries are all
entered by the routine %ZTER.  There is no need for a user to make a manual entry into this file.
