              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the name of the key, prefixed with the package code 
              DESCRIPTION:      Each entry in this File is the name of a key that defines some characteristic or capability for individual specified users.  The capability might be access to some OPTION (file 19) which is permited with the authorization.  
                                Other functionalities (such as allowing scheduling overbook) might also be allowed only if the key is held.  
                                 
                                Keys are named with the standard package prefix formats; a 2-4 character package prefix for standard names or Z.

                                This X-ref will clean-up the XUSEC global if a key is removed by an app calling DIK directly.  If the UNEDITABLE flag was removed and the KEY name changed it would clean-up the old name from XUSEC BUT would not set in the

                                This is a normal X-ref that has the special code to see that the X-ref is in all uppercase for easy lookup.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Should a X-ref of holders of this key be made for person lookup. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field when set to 'lookup' will build a X-ref on the NEW PERSON file of all holders of the key.  This will be under a X-ref of 'AK.'_<keyname> so that a package can lookup members of a group.  
                                 
                                There is a standard SECURITY KEY that will be sent out of 'PROVIDER' with the lookup flag set. Then a package can do a lookup of PROVIDER's with the following code: S DIC="^VA(200,",D="AK.PROVIDER",DIC(0)="AEQ" D IX^DIC

              HELP-PROMPT:      Does the user need to keep this key when terminated. 
              DESCRIPTION:      If this field is set to YES (1) then this key will not be removed from a user in the New Person file when they are terminated.  
                                 
                                One example is the 'PROVIDER' key.

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 22, 2005 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field controls if this is a Security Key that should be sent to the J2EE application server for temporary role assignment.  
                                 
                                If this field is set to 'Yes' then this Security Key can be sent to the application server.

                HELP-PROMPT:      A cluster of keys to allow easier key assignment. 
                DESCRIPTION:
                                  Subordinate authorization is "given" at the same time the "master" authorization is "given".  This permits more efficient and easier delegation of authority.

                EXPLANATION:      The person clustering authorizations must have the authority not only to delegate but also the authority to give others the authority to delegate.
