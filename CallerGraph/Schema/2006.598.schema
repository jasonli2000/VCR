As a DICOM Gateway performs its various tasks, there are occasions where error messages need to be transmitted to remote recipients (FileMan users and/or mailgroups as well as SMTP mail recipients).  
 
When such a message needs to be transmitted, a new entry is made into this table, which will contain the message text and some information about the message. Then an attempt is made to transmit the message.  When the transmission is successful, the entry
is removed from this table.  
 
When the transmission is not successful (which is likely since many errors that need to be transmitted have to report some type of "network failure") the text remains in this table while the software on the DICOM Gateway can enter its further error 
processing.  
 
A supervisory task on the DICOM Gateway scans the content of this table on a regular basis and will transmit any "left over" messages.  As soon as a message has been transmitted successfully, its entry in this table will be removed.
