This file contains the descriptions and codes for all etiology categories.  This file contains etiology categories for both traumatic and disease types.  Field .02 (Type of Cause) is used to determine whether the Description and Code Within Type of Cause
for an entry is a traumatic etiology or a disease etiology entry.  For example, code 01 could be, Auto Accident or Poliomyelitis, but the 'T' in field .02 makes it a traumatic etiology, so it is an Auto Accident.
