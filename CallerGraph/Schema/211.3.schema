              DESCRIPTION:      This number will determine the order in which a service position will print out on a report.   A service position with a priority sequence of 200 will sort and print before a service position with a priority sequence of
                                900. There are some restrictions on this numbering system: 1.  Service positions with priority sequences 
                                    of less than 100 will not print on reports.  
                                    This is to enable the user to add a service 
                                    position that is not desired in the prints.  
                                 
                                2.  No two service positions can have duplicate priority sequences.
