                                         When the RTHIST job is started, it requires the number of table entries to be specified.  If the entry for table size is too small, then a ~TABLE,FULL~ condition will occurr.  
                                   
                                         If you define this field (i.e. Not Null), then I will use this value for the MAXIMUM RTHIST table size.  
                                   
                                         On the other hand, if you leave this field Null, then I will use the MAX AM TABLE SIZE field (#6) to adjust the AM RTHIST table size for the morning RTHIST session, or the MAX PM TABLE SIZE field (#7) to adjust 
                                  the PM RTHIST table size for the afternoon RTHIST session.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between .1 and 999999, 1 Decimal Digit 
              DESCRIPTION:             Some DHCP routines are executed very briefly.  Therefore, the number of commands they execute are relativity very small for a RTHIST session.  A "bucket" called '<thresh' in the Routine command report is where all 
                                command counts for these types of routine(s) will be collected.  For example, if routine ABC executes 976 commands for a RTHIST session and you specify 1000 as the thresh hold value, then ABC's command count will be placed
                                in the '<thresh' bucket.

              DESCRIPTION:             Some DHCP routines reference global(s) very little.  Therefore, the number of global references are relativity very small for a RTHIST session.  A "bucket" called '<thresh' in the Global Access report is where all
                                these type of global(s) will get placed.  For example, if global ABC is referenced 109 times fora RTHIST session and you specify 300 as the thresh hold, the ABC's reference count will be placed in the '<thresh' bucket.
