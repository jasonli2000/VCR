              DESCRIPTION:      VA Type of Service Codes are codes that have been created to track "types" of medical services provided to fee basis patients so that a cost analysis can be completed.  With this information we can compare outpatient VA
                                costs to outpatient fee basis costs for "types" of care provided.  When assigning the VA Type of Service Code we are trying to "group" types of VA outpatient care which is recorded by outpatient stop code and are reflected
                                in the Cost Distribution Report(CDR).  When uncertain of what fee basis VA Type of Service code to use - determine how you would designate the care provided if you were recording VA outpatient treatment.
