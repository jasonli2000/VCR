This file contains descriptions of 'selection lists'.  A selection list is a rectangular area in a block that contains a list. The list has 'columns' of 'selections'. The columns have 'subcolumns', which can either contain text or  a 'marking area'.  A
marking area is an area on the form designed to be checked to indicate that a choice is being made from the list.
