This file contains Conversion Specification Templates (CST) that are used by the ACRP Database Conversion (SD*5.3*137). These templates allow management of the conversion process to meet the needs of the individual site.  
 
Each template contains the following: 
      1) Start and End dates for encounters to be converted 
      2) Event logs (estimate, convert, re-convert) 
      3) Action logs (schedule, stop, re-start) 
      4) Error logs 
      5) Conversion event start/stop parameters 
      6) Estimate statistics 
      7) Record creation statistics 
 
The database conversion logic utilizes and updates the information stored in each CST.
