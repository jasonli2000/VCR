Records of this file store parameters of the historical data extractions (backpulls) performed on the registries and reflect status of these data extractions.  
 
Records of the file are uniquely identified by the historical data extraction name (the "A" primary key and the uniqueness index "B" are used for that purpose).

                DESCRIPTION:      The output file name is stored in this field. This name is generated automatically when the task is created. The name has the following structure: 
                                   
                                     BASE-SSS-TT.HDT 
                                   
                                  where 'BASE' is the base part of the file name provided by the user during creation of the task table 'SSS' is the site number (3 digits), and 'TT' is the sequential number of the task (2 digits).  
                                   
                                  If the task is restarted, the optional numeric modifier '##' (2 digits) can be added to the name so that the already extracted data will not be overwritten: 
                                   
                                     BASE-SSS-TT-##.HDT 
                                   
                                  Usually, this field should not be edited. It is populated automatically when the task is created or restarted.

                                  When the data extraction task is restarted, it tries to re-extract the data for these patients.  If it succeeds, it deletes the corresponding records from the list.
