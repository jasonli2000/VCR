This file contains implementation-specific information about the installation and use of the BCMA Backup system on the client workstation.  
 
This file is distributed with a pre-defined entry labelled "ONE".  Further, the .01 field for this entry is marked uneditable.  This pre-defined entry should not be deleted.  No additional PARAMETERS entries should be made as they will be ignored by the
BCMA Backup System.  
 
There are five fields that can be edited in this file:  DEFAULT DAYS FOR MAR (field #1), DEFAULT MAR PRINTER (field #2), PURGE ORDER DAYS (field 5), PURGE PATIENT (field 6) and MED-LOG NUMBER (field 7). The option BCMA Backup System Parameters Edit (ALPB
PARAMS EDIT) is provided for editing of these fields.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 7, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      The number in this field indicates the default number of days for which medication administration initial boxes are printed on the output forms.  For example, if the number of days is 3, then the printed outputs will 
                                contain initial boxes beside each printed order that will look like this:

                                     (These "initial boxes" are printed so that staff can record 
                                      medication administration at the prescribed times.) 
                                                                 
                                The usual number of days is 3 and this file is distributed with this value as a default (pre-defined).  If the value is deleted, the BCMA Backup System software defaults to 3 days as well.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 07, 2003 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field will be used to designate a default printer for the printing of Medication Administration Records (MAR).  
                                                                 
                                If this field contains a device entry, it will be presented as the default print location for the MARs in the Device handler calls in the BCMA MAR print options. The user can either accept this default device, or select 
                                another valid device from the Device file.

              DESCRIPTION:      This multiple field contains individual entries describing errors encountered by the processing of HL7 messages and the filing of data in the BCMA BACKUP DATA FILE (#53.7).  This field should not be edited using File
                                Manager. Display and deletion of individual errors in this field is handled with the option ALPB ERROR LOG.

                DESCRIPTION:      The number in this field is the patient's record number in file 53.7.  The field is not defined as a pointer to file 53.7 due to the dynamics of file 53.7.  The Error Log processing routine (ALPBELOG) handles the
                                  deletion of entries in this file (53.71) when processing through errors.  If a patient no longer has a record in file 53.7, then any entry for the patient encountered in this file will be deleted.

                DESCRIPTION:
                                  The number in this field is the record number in file 772 for the HL7 message that contains the segment for which this filing error was logged.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field can contain either the HL7 segment identifier (for example, PID, PV1, RXE, etc.) -or- a code signifying some other kind of filing error (for example "NEWORD" could be found in this field indicating an error
                                  occurred while attempting to add the order into file 53.7).

                  DESCRIPTION:      The number in this field is usually equal to a File Manager error code.  This code is generated/returned by File Manager when an error is generated by data passed to the FMDBS calls used in the BCMA Backup System
                                    package.  
                                                                       
                                    Note, however, that this field could also contain a code '999' which indicates that some other type of filing error occurred. The ERROR TEXT field will contain the explanation of the error.
