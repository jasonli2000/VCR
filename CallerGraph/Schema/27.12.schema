              DESCRIPTION:      This field will indicate the status of the query.  When a query needs to be re-sent due to non-response, the status of the original query will be changed to RE-TRANSMITTED.  If a response is no longer required, its status
                                can be changed to CLOSED to prevent it from being re-sent.
