                                  When the parameters are different for the conversion to a 'clinical resolution' image than they are for a 'full resolution' image, the value of this field consists of two parts, separated by a slash ("/").  In that case,
                                  the first part specifies the parameters for clinical images, and the second part specifies the parameters for the full images.
