              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter one Alpha character (mandatory) followed by 1 Numeric (optional). 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indexes the order that data must be loaded into the respective fields at the Querying Site.  
                                 
                                Is of the format 1 Alpha character followed by an optional Numeric character.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Referenced by Register Once Messaging routine which loads data returned from the Last Site Treated into the Querying Site.  
                                 
                                Is of the format 1 Alpha character followed by an optional Numeric character.  
                                 
                                With exception of the Patient file, Indices used must contain a single file, only.  The Patient file can be referenced across multiple indices to set order of entry for fields in that file.  However, Register Once
                                Messaging will not support other files using multiple indices.  
                                 
                                The ORDER INDEX field must contain a letter and optionally may be followed by a number.  The optional number is not used with initial release but is allowed so that further levels of order may be added within a specific
                                "letter group" for the Patient file.  
                                 
                                The DG REGISTER ONCE FIELD DEFINITION file is released with ORDER INDEX defined for each field.  Groups of fields in the Patient file has been defined with upper case letters.  Fields in other files have been defined with
                                lower case letters.  This is done to support greater expansion for entries in the Patient file.  Use of upper case letters for fields in files other than the Patient file should be avoided unless those fields are depended
                                upon by Patient file fields.  
                                 
                                Reasons for the Constraints on defining ORDER INDEX values: 
                                  Register Once Messaging is designed so that this field's value 
                                  assumes a record EDIT for the PATIENT file (#2), ONLY.  Fields 
                                  in other files and PATIENT file multiples will be added as new 
                                  records.  Examples of other files include the DG SECURITY LOG 
                                  file (#38.1).  Examples of PATIENT file multiples include the 
                                  Patient file ALIAS multiple (2.01).  
                                 
                                  The ORDER INDEX will NOT support adding data to existing records 
                                  in any file or multiple EXCEPT the PATIENT file.  This means that 
                                  only fields in the Patient file can have an ORDER INDEX different 
                                  from another field in the Patient file.  
                                 
                                Ordering modifications for the fields defined in this file MUST be designed according to this ordering specification or a technical redesign of ROM will be necessary.  

              CROSS-REFERENCE:  391.23^D 
                                1)= S ^DGRO(391.23,"D",$E(X,1,30),DA)=""

                                This cross reference is required to define the arrays passed between FileMan calls in Register Once Messaging software.  The ORDER INDEX field defines the order that groups of fields are loaded into the data base at the
                                Querying Site.
