                                This function call makes the assumption that the ^TMP("SCENI XMT",$J,0) global from the Incomplete Encounter Management List Manager tool is available to retrieve the pointer from the TRANSMITTED OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER FILE
                                (#409.73) which is used to check the entry and retreive the entry from the TRANSMITTED OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER ERROR FILE (#409.75).
