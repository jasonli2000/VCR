              DESCRIPTION:      This is the processing status of the form.  This field is automatically updated by the system.  When a form is printed for a patient an entry is created in this file and the processing status is set to printed.  When data
                                is received by DHCP from the scanner the status is updated to Scanned.  After the data is processed by PCE the status is updated to show the correct status. 
                                 
                                For multi-page forms, when not all pages have been scanned, the status is set to Pending Pages.  The data is stored in this file from the scanned pages and merged with the rest of the data when all pages have been scanned. 
                                Then the complete data is sent to PCE.  
                                 
                                This is used to prevent sending data from a form to PCE more that once.  The only exception is that if PCE returns an error, PCE did not store any data and the form may be re-scanned.
