This file will be used to track the archiving and purging operations of the following three data files used in billing: 
 
  #350  INTEGRATED BILLING ACTION 
  #351  CATEGORY C BILLING CLOCK 
  #399  BILL/CLAIMS 
 
A log entry will be filed when an archival "search" is initiated for one of these files.  Once the search end date is logged, archiving will be permitted, and subsequently purging will be allowed when the archive end date is logged.  The log entry is
thus used to assure that all the necessary steps for archiving and purging are performed in their entirety in the correct order.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

                                is stored instead of a hard pointer to the SORT TEMPLATE file because the template is deleted from the file after the entries have been purged.  The name of the template is the string "IB ARCHIVE/PURGE #" concatenated with
                                the Archive Log # (field .01).

                                The 'Archive' option will update this field with the number of entries archived.  The 'Purge' option will update the field with the number of entries purged.  Also, the 'Delete Entry From Search Template' option will
                                update the field when entries from the template are deleted.

                                error is detected during processing which invalidates the operation.
