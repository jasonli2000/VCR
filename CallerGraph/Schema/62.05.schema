An urgency status is defined as the priority given to each laboratory test, or how quickly that test must be performed by laboratory personnel, based on site-specific criteria.  This file contains eight pre-supplied urgencies: STAT,ASAP,PRE-OP,CALL
RESULT,ADMIT,OUTPATIENT,PURPLE TRIANGLE (or service-connected disability) and ROUTINE, each assigned a numerical priority, with '1' for 'STAT' being highest priority, and '9' for 'ROUTINE' being the lowest priority.  
 
NOTE: Workload logic uses a new class of urgencies which are prefixed with 'WKL-'.  These urgencies are not selectable by the user. Also WKL- prevents non- lab users from seeing these tests. These urgencies are used to calculate LMIP data only.  
  These urgencies begin with internal entry numbers of >49 and are assigned by the verification process for LMIP data calculation.
