This file contains data associated with the Pharmacy Drug Accountability Stats location.  Entries in this file may be edited but not deleted.  Entries in this file should NOT be edited directly using VA FileMan.  
  
This file is designed to be shared between the Drug Accountability module and the Controlled Substances module of the Pharmacy software.  The Controlled Substances module will recognize a location as a Narcotic Area of Use (NAOU). The menu option
Inactivate NAOU [PSD INACTIVATE NAOU] is used to inactivate NAOUs no longer in use.  The menu option Inactivate NAOU Stock Drug [PSD INACTIVATE NAOU STOCK DRUG] is used to inactivate drugs no longer stocked within that NAOU.
