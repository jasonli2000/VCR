              DESCRIPTION:      Beginning with the Outpatient Meals release this field will simply be a free text field.  This file will need to point to either File #2 or File #200 and those pointer values will be stored in fields #14 & #15
                                respectively.  Those 2 fields will be mutually exclusive, ie, each entry in this file must have a pointer value in EITHER field #14 OR field #15, BUT NOT BOTH.  
                                 
                                Previously, this field was a pointer to the main ^DPT file and had the same internal number as that file. Thus, the patient's name was the ^DPT name.  This was no longer feasible since it was necessary to point to file
                                #200 also.  
                                 
                                This field will now store either "P" followed by a pointer value to file #2 or an "N" followed by a pointer value to #200.  For example, this field might store P27 for IEN #27 in file #2.  Or this field might store N1866
                                for IEN #1866 in file #200.
