                DESCRIPTION:       STARTING MONTH is used by the PM module as a criterion for determining when a PM is due. Let's consider a fairly complex example: an item subject to MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, and ANNUAL PM inspections. If STARTING MONTH were 
                                  set to FEB; an ANNUAL inspection would be scheduled in FEB; QUARTERLY inspections in MAY, AUG, and NOV; and MONTHLY inspections in MAR, APR, JUN, JUL, SEP, OCT, DEC, and JAN. 
                                   If STARTING MONTH is left blank, JAN will be assumed.

                DESCRIPTION:       A range of months (inclusive) during which PMI's are to be suspended.  For example, an entry of 'NOV-MAR' for an air-conditioner would suppress the scheduling of any PMI's in NOV, DEC, JAN, FEB, and MAR.  
                                   Some care needs to be taken when using this field. If you want an ANNUAL inspecton, for instance, be sure that the STARTING MONTH is not within the range specified by the SKIP MONTHS; otherwise the ANNUAL PMI will never
                                  be scheduled.  
                                   Entries must take the form 'MMM-NNN', where MMM is a three character abbreviation of the first month for which PMiI's are to be suspended and NNN is a three character abbreviation for the last month for which PMI's are
                                  to be suspended. Valid abbreviations are: JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, and DEC.

                DESCRIPTION:      An index of the importance of performing PMI's on this device. Enter an integer between 1 and some upper limit not greater than 99 (most sites use 10 or 20). The closer the values are to the upper limit the more critical 
                                  the PMI's become. A value of 1 would indicate that PMI's are desireable but far from essential (least critical).  
                                   
                                  When PM worklists are generated, the system will ask if all devices should be included or just those whose CRITICALITY is within a certain user selectable range (say, 7 to 10). This is intended as a means of adjusting
                                  workload to match available resources.  
                                   
                                  Use of this feature is left entirely to the discretion of each site. If a CRITICALITY range is selected, the system will ask the user whether devices having no CRITICALITY should be included or excluded.

                                      SEMI-ANNUAL in MAR and SEP;

                                       Level 1 - Visual inspection only; 
                                       Level 2 - Check and adjust operator controls; 
                                       Level 3 - Electrical safety analysis;

                                     LEVEL is an optional field and is intended to accommodate the needs of certain facilities with highly developed PM programs. Entries for LEVEL (if any) will be printed on the PM worklist as a reminder to the 
                                    responsible technician.

                                "Local assessment" generally means that specific information from the VA web site and/or the device manufacturer is unavailable (and perhaps unnecessary). In these cases, Y2K categorization is made on the basis of the

                                Sites are cautioned against attempting to perform actual Y2K compliance tests on equipment that may have Y2K problems because advanced date simulation in systems with embedded microprocessors may be very difficult to

              LAST EDITED:      AUG 26, 1998 
              DESCRIPTION:      Indicate which devices in a facilities equipment inventory are included in some kind of Facility Management System.  
                                 
                                Whenever a user enters a Y2K UTILITY SYSTEM for an entry that is a PARENT of other equipment entries, then AEMS/MERS will automatically assign that Y2K UTILITY SYSTEM to all descendents of that parent entry.  
                                 
                                The Y2K UTILITY SYSTEM field will have special significance in centralized reporting of Y2K compliance activities, but the utility of this classification scheme is expected to outlive the Y2K compliance effort.  
                                 
                                Some specific examples of utility systems are as follows:

              DESCRIPTION:      The purpose of this field is to allow IT users to enter a free-text value when there is not a suitable location in the ENG SPACE (#6928) file to select.  The intention is that entry of a free-text location value will

                                location has been added and then the requester can use an IT edit option to update the equipment location and delete the non-space file location.

                                Fixed Assets/FMS, but does not meet the new capitalization threshold of $100,000. After the one-time task has run on July 24, 2002, this field will be obsolete and it will be deleted by a subsequent patch.  
                                 
                                This field can be updated by the Adjust List of Equipment to be Expensed by Task option.  If this field is populated then the associated equipment item will not be expensed even though it meets the other criteria to be
