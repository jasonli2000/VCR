This file is used to store charge data from various VistA applications so that a background process can create an HL7 P03 message from each record.  The messages are batched and sent to the external medical billing system.  
  
Under no circumstances may records be created or modified directly via FileMan or other methods.  Record creation and data update is allowed only through CHARGE^IBBAPI.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

                                All data provided to the PFSS CHARGE CACHE file by PCE will include the ORDER file IEN, if known by PCE.  If the charge is the result of a Radiology exam, then IBB will query OERR to obtain the PFSS Account Reference
                                associated with the order IEN.  IBB will then convert that PFSS Account Reference to its external medical billing system equivalent using $$EXTNUM^IBBAACCT.  This external billing system number is included in the outbound
                                charge message as a Secondary Visit Number, so that the Radiology charge can be related to back to the original outpatient visit or inpatient episode by the billing system.
