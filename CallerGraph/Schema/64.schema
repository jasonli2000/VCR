                                 Utilities are provided for local sites to manipulate distributed file data to meet their needs. If a site determines a procedure which they perform is not in this file, they are to contact VACO pathology for procedures to
                                obtain new entries.

                                reports will indicate those entries not pointed to any local accession area.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Select 'Rpt Date' for subscript of ordered test 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Used for Microbiology ("MI" subscript) and Anatomic Pathology ("SP", "EM", "CY" subscripts) to link the reportable components of a report with its corresponding orderable test.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Used by LDSI II message building software to determine which reports should be contained out-going HL7 messages.  
                                 
                                Example 1: 
                                 
                                Select LABORATORY TEST NAME:    CULTURE & SUSCEPTIBILITY NATIONAL VA LAB CODE: Culture & Sensitivity// MI/AP DATABASE CODE: MI Bacteria Rpt Date// 
                                 
                                Orderable test in LABORATORY TEST (#60) is "Culture and Sensitivity." 
                                 
                                The "NATIONAL VA LAB CODE" (#64) field is linked to "Culture & Sensitivity".  
                                 
                                Now the "Culture & Sensitivity" code in WKLD CODE (#64) field "MI/AP DATABASE CODE"  (#63) field would point to "MI Bacteriology Rpt Date" 
                                 
                                 
                                Example 2:

                                Now the "Culture Viral" code in WKLD CODE (#64) file field "MI/AP DATABASE" field (#63) is linked to "MI Virology Rpt Date" 
                                 
                                 
                                Example 3:
