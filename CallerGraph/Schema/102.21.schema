The CPRS query tool provides a mechanism by which clinical users may search for items typically managed by CPRS.  These are very limited types of queries.  A wizard helps the user construct the criteria used in the query.  
 
This file contains definitions of queries used to build reports of CPRS items (orders, consults, documents).  Each query definition contains a list of constraints.  These constraints are used by the query routines to return a subset of CPRS items.  
 
This file also contains definitions of report criteria.  These criteria are selected and modified by the user when building custom reports.  A report criterion contains a list of constraints that apply to the particular criterion. A critieron behaves
much like a "mini-report".  
 
The other part of a query definition stored in this file is the list of fields to be displayed after the query is run.  The query produces a columnar report with the selected display field in each column.
