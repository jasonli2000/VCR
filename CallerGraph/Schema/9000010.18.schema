The V CPT file has been defined for joint use by the Indian Health Service and the Department of Veteran Affairs. This is the file used to store CPT related services performed at a visit.  Data must exist for a patient and a visit before data can be
entered in the V CPT file.  
 
This file is used in the VA to identify procedures that were done to a patient at an encounter or occassion of service.  The procedures may have been performed by a primary or secondary provider of patient care.  Procedures checked off and scanned from
ambulatory care encounter forms are stored here to record that they were done.  Results of procedures are not included.  
 
This file is restricted to procedures that have a CPT code.  The V Treatment file is used to store procedures without CPT codes that do not fit into any other V-file category.  
 
The Provider Narrative field represents the preferred text for this procedure as defined by the clinician.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the date and time the procedure was done. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the date and time the procedure was performed.  This date and time may be different from the visit data and time.  For example, for clinic appointment visits, the visit date and time is the date and time of the 
                                appointment, not the time the provder performed the clinical event.  
                                 
                                The date may be an imprecise date.  
                                 
                                Date and time may be within 30 days before or after the visit date, with the restriction the date cannot be a future date.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE User Interface, which allows manual entry of data, will be the primary source of the event date and time.  The event date prompt defaults to the visit date and the time is entered to reflect the actual time the
                                service was provided.  The event date does not have to be the visit date, but it must be within 30 days before or after the visit, and not be a future date.  
                                 
                                If a user wants to enter a historical procedure, the user should use the Historical Encounter entry action to document the historical measurement. Historical entries will not be eligible for credit.

                                If the record is a new record, then an "A" is used to specify the source that added the data.  If the record existed previously, PCE filing logic compares the old and new records of information.  An "E" will be
                                automatically used if the filing logic finds the data has been edited.  If "E" is used, then the Edited Flag field is automatically set to 1.  
                                 
                                The DUZ is stored in its internal format to represent the user who performed the adding or editing of data for this record.
