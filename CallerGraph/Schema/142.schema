This file contains the structure of a Health Summary.  Components from the Health Summary Components file (142.1) may be selected and restricted by number of occurrences or time limits. The original creator of a type of Health Summary is the owner of
that type.  Health Summaries that are "owned" may not be modified or deleted by anyone else, except the Clinical Coordinator.  "Owned" Health Summaries may be used by other users to print patient information.  
  
The GMTSMGR security key is included on generic Health Summaries sent out with the Health Summary Package.  These types of Health Summaries should not be deleted.

                                NOTE: When a new health summary type is created, the creator's entry number in the new Person File is AUTOMATICALLY entered as Owner unless the creator holds the GMTSMGR security key.  A creator who holds the GMTSMGR key

              DESCRIPTION:      This field allows health summary types to be set up to suppress printing of components that contain no data when health summaries are printed from a device. When health summary types are displayed on the screen, components
                                that contain no data will still be displayed with a "No data available" message. This is done to eliminate any confusion that may occur when jumping between components.

                                  This REGULAR "B" cross-reference is created by FileMan and because the multiple is DINUM'ed by SUMMARY ORDER, it serves little useful function in either look-up or sorting.

                                  This REGULAR FileMan type cross-reference is used both in look-ups of components and to determine whether the selected component already exists in the current Health Summary Type during the Create/Modify process.

                                  This MUMPS type cross-reference is used to recompile the navigational and ad hoc menus when components are added to/deleted from a given Health Summary Type. The ^XUTL("XQORM", global is used by the Unwinder utility to

                                  This cross-reference is used by the routine ^GMTSDD to build the navigational menu for each Health Summary Type, and by ^GMTSLOAD when saving the current default parameters, prior to deleting and rebuilding the Ad Hoc

                  DESCRIPTION:      When a given component allows the selection of specific items, (e.g., lab tests, radiology procedures, vital measurements, measurement panels, clinical reminders/maintenance items, health factors, etc.), you may select
                                    the item by simply entering its name (e.g., POTASSIUM, or PULSE, as appropriate). If a limit has been specified for the number of items to be selected, then the build health summary option will restrict you to that 
                                    number.
