                                  This allows the site to enter information pertaining to a shift on a hospital location by hospital location basis.  The wards used are from the HOSPITAL LOCATION file.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:    This allows the site to enter certain information (e.g., start/stop times) about the shift specifically by hospital location.  The hospital location point to the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#42) file.  In processing, the hospital 
                                location is determined by the ward on which the patient is shown to reside.
