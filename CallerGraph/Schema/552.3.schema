              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to control filing of the data in the CMOP Master Database file and purging the entries from the CMOP Release file.  If purge=1, the record is ready to purge from the file.  If purge=2, the record is
                                ready to file in the CMOP Master Database file.  If purge=3, the record is a duplicate Rx returned by the vendor software.  If purge=4, the record was rejected by DHCP during the query.
