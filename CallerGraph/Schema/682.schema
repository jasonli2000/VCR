                DESCRIPTION:      This field automatically indicates the date and time when the routing slips for an issue were initially printed.  If the printer fails and routing slips must be reprinted using the RRS option with a range of dates and
                                  times, the RRS option would identify routing slips to be reprinted by the values found in this field.
