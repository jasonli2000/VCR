              DESCRIPTION:      This is the date and time the exam was given by the provider.  This date and time may be different from the visit date and time.  For example, for clinic appointment visits, the visit date and time is the date and time of
                                the appointment, not the time the provider performed the clinical event.

                                Date and time may be within 30 days before or after the visit date, with the restriction the date cannot be a future date.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE User Interface, which allows manual entry of data, will be the primary source of the event date and time.  The event date prompt defaults to the visit date, and the time is entered to reflect the actual time the 
                                measurement was done.  The event date does not have to be the visit date, but it must be within 30 days before or after the visit, and not be a future date.  
                                 
                                If a user wants to enter a historical measurement, the user should use the Historical Encounter entry action to document the historical measurement.  Historical entries will not be eligible for credit.  
                                 
                                PCE Data Sources for automatic (scanning) data capture will be blank unless the event date and time are passed to PCE for filing.  APCDALVR Variable = APCDALVR("APCDTCDT")

                                If the record is a new record, then an "A" is used to specify the source that added the data.  If the record existed previously, PCE filing logic compares the old and new records of information.  An "E" will be 
                                automatically used if the filing logic finds the data has been edited.  If "E" is used, then the Edited Flag field is automatically set to 1.  
                                 
                                The DUZ is stored in its internal format to represent the user who performed the addition or editing of data for this record.
