This file contains lookup key names that are mapped to WEB SERVER file entries.  
 
These key-to-server mappings allow application developers to code using key names and call the appropriate HWSC API at run-time to resolve the server using the key name as input to the API.  
 
There is also a deployment time API that can be use to registered the key name during the installation of application.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the lookup key value.  
                                 
                                This value is often entered by an application during the post-init process using the SKEYADD^XOBWLIB() API.  
                                 
                                At run-time, the application will use the SNAME4KY^XOBWLIB(<key>) API to retrieve the name of the server the site has associated with the key.  
                                 
                                The value must be unique compared to the KEY NAME field value of the other entries in this file.  
                                 
                                The value will be forced to all uppercase if it is not already all uppercase when entered.
