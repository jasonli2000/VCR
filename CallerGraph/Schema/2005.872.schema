This file is used to map DICOM modalities and specialties to procedure pointers that can be populated into the PROC/EVENT Field (#43) of the IMAGE File (#2005).  
 
Function $$FIELD43^MAGXMA(XMOD,XSPEC,XPROC) returns in XPROC the procedure pointer defined under modality XMOD for specialty XSPEC, if XSPEC is sent and is defined in this file.  Otherwise, the function returns the default procedure for XMOD, if one is
defined; else it returns a null value.  
 
This file is not to be modified by sites.
