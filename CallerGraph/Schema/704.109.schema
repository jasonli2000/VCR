This file correlates a vendor (VENDOR KEY field #.1) with a mapping-table (MAPPING TABLE ID field #.01) and an HL7 message segment (TERM TYPE field #.03).  A sample entry could be interpreted as follows: 
         Mapping-TableXX is used for processing when VendorX has sent an 
         XType message.
