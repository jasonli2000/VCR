REGIONAL TREATMENT MODALITY is intended to identify the dominant modality of therapy delivered to the primary volume of interest.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to choose a code for its academic or economic interest, even though it may not reflect
the majority of the patient's therapy.  For example, a patient with carcinoma of the nasopharynx may receive original treatment using a linear accelerator and then have a boost with High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy.  In a department with a special
interest in brachytherapy, the code 15 would be chosen.  
 
This field can be useful in assessing resource utilization, planning for expansion, or monitoring quality.  It should be used at the discretion of the Radiation Oncologist.
