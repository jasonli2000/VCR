              LAST EDITED:      OCT 20, 1988 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the date of the current network workday.  This will usually be the current day's date.  On days that the network is unavailable (weekends and holidays) this field will contain the value of the previous
                                network workday's date.  For example, on a Sunday, this field will contain the date of the previous Friday.  
                                 
                                The value in this field is updated automatically by the system on workdays when a HINQ request is sent.  It should not be necessary to edit 
                                 this field.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  S %DT="ETX" D ^%DT S X=Y K:Y<1 X
              LAST EDITED:      NOV 01, 1988 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the date of the network workday that is previous to the current network workday.  For example, on a Tuesday, it contains Monday's date.  On a Sunday, the network workday is still Friday so Last
                                Net-Workday will contain Thursday's date.  
                                 
                                When the parameter, NETWORK DAY, is updated on workdays, LAST NET-WORKDAY field is automatically updated to the value of the previous NETWORK DAY. Thus at times LAST NET-WORKDAY can be days apart from NETWORK DAY because a
                                HINQ hasn't been requested to update the field. For example if NETWORK DAY is a Monday and LAST NET-WORKDAY is Friday and no HINQs are done until Thursday, on Thursday the NETWORK DAY will contain Thursday's date but LAST
                                NET-WORKDAY will contain Monday's date.  If a HINQ is done again on Friday then NETWORK DAY will be Friday's date and LAST NET-WORKDAY will be Thursday's.  
                                 
                                VIEW THE HINQ SUSPENSE FILE option displays entries beginning with the current day's date and going back to the LAST NET-WORKDAY'S date.  It may be necessary to edit this field to contain an earlier date to extend the date
                                range of this options. On the following workday, this field will get updated as usual to the previous NETWORK DAY'S date.

                                These options are automatically disabled during VBA computer non-workday hours.  However, it may be necessary to disable these options temporarily if transmission problems are occurring.

                                during workday hours and this field contains a NO, a test of the network is automatically performed.  This field will be set to a YES or NO value that indicates whether or not the HINQ Suspense file contains 'P'ending
                                entries. The system sets this field.  If this field is set to NO, queued jobs will quit before logging into the remote VBA.  It may be manually reset to YES if there are pending entries in the suspense file.
