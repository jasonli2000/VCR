This file contains all the procedures that may be associated with an imaging exam.  The entries in this file are the allowable choices the user will be able to pick from at the procedure prompt. This prompt appears as part of the 'Register', 'Case No.
Edit' and the 'Exam Status Tracking' functions of the module.  
 
If the procedure has an inactivation date less than the current date then the procedure is not a valid choice and will not appear on the list of valid/active procedures when displayed to the user.  
 
Once this software is in production, you should never delete any entries.  Entries can be deactivated by entering an 'inactivation' date for the entry. Adding new entries is always allowed.  
 
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
The data for the 'RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURES' file is stored in the ^RAMIS(71, global. At the present time this file is very static after day-one initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.  It should also be translated if the
operating system supports this function.  
 
 Input Templates 
 ---------------
 The following is a list of input templates used by the package 
 and the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template: 
 
 Name                 Routine            Description; Option(s) 
                     Compiled 
 ____                ________            ____________
 RA PROCEDURE EDIT             Use to enter/edit procedure to the file; 
 
If any modifications to this input template are needed for local purposes, then great care should be taken not to degrade any branching logic in the template.

              LAST EDITED:      APR 30, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter '1' if the radiopharmaceutical prompt(s) should be suppressed when this procedure is performed on a patient. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This question only applies to procedures with an imaging type that use radiopharmaceuticals (i.e. nuclear medicine or cardiology studies). If the exam status set-up for the affected imaging types specifies that 
                                radiopharmaceutical data should be asked and/or required to progress to various statuses, this field can be used to over-ride that requirement.  
                                 
                                Available categories are defined as follows: 
                                 
                                    0 or blank - Always ask for Radiopharmaceutical if and when exam 
                                        status parameters specify (this is the default).  
                                 
                                    1 - Suppress the radiopharmaceutical prompts.  Never ask or require 
                                        Radiopharmaceutical even if exam status parameters specify that a 
                                        Radiopharmaceutical should be entered. Even if default 
                                        Radiopharmaceuticals are entered for the procedure they will not 
                                        be automatically entered on the exam record by the system when the 
                                        case is registered.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Select a device which will print flash cards for this procedure. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the name (1-20 characters) of the location where the flash cards for this procedure are to be printed.  Normally, the flash cards are printed at the reception desk, however, for particular procedures
                                the flash cards may be printed at a different location such as where the exam is to be performed.  
                                 
                                NOTE:  The exam labels will print out on the flash card printer associated 
                                       with the imaging location parameter (e.g., the reception desk).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the format for this flash card. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to define the format of the flash card.  Normally, the standard default format for the user's rad/nuc med location is used, however, particular procedures may require a flash card format that is 
                                different than the standard format.

              DESCRIPTION:      If this field is set to YES, case edits will prompt for meds administered for this procedure.  To make Status Tracking prompt for meds administered, this field is set to YES, and the Examination Status parameter 'Ask 
                                Medications & Dosages' is set to yes for one or more statuses of the procedure's imaging type.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the appropriate procedure type. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains a value to indicate the type of rad/nuc med procedure.  Valid choices are: 'B' for Broad, 'D' for Detailed, 'S' for Series, and 'P' for Parent. 'Broad' can be used when the procedure is being initially 
                                registered, but must be changed by the technologist to 'Detailed' or 'Series' procedure before the exam is completed.  'Series' is used when there is more than one AMIS code associated with this exam procedure.  'Parent'
                                procedures should be used to pre-define a group of procedures (descendents).  When a procedure is marked as a 'Parent', the system will ask for its 'descendents' (other procedures in this file that are part of the
                                procedure group). During the 'Register an Exam' option, these 'descendent' procedures will be registered as a set under one exam date/time.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field contains a number (0-99) to indicate to the various workload report routines how many times to multiply the weighted work units associated with the AMIS code.  The weight for each AMIS code is stored in the
                                  'MAJOR RAD/NUC MED AMIS CODE' file.  
                                   
                                  Most multipliers will be 1.  However, there are some that are greater than 1.  For example, the procedure called 'UPPER GI + SMALL BOWEL' has the AMIS code 9-GASTROINTESTINAL which has a weight of 6 work units.  But, the
                                  AMIS multiplier is 2.  Therefore on the workload reports, the site will get credit for 12 weighted work units each time it is performed.  
                                   
                                  Radiology Central Office has directed that the weighted work unit for Ultrasound procedures involving multiple organs in the same visit can be counted only once if the organs are located close to each other.  (i.e.  
                                  Liver and Gallbladder)

                LAST EDITED:      FEB 16, 1985 
                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a 'YES' if this procedure is considered bilateral. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This field will contain a 'Yes' to indicate that this is a bilateral procedure or a 'No' if it is not a bilateral procedure.  If it contains a 'Yes', then the system multiplies the AMIS weight by 2. 
                                   
                                  No harm is done by indicating the 'Multiplier' as '2' and 'Bilateral' as 'Yes'.  The system will only use '2' as the multiplier, not (2*2) '4'.

                                  Radiology Central Office has directed that the weighted work unit for two CT procedures performed in the same visit can be counted twice only if the procedures are performed on the 'head' and the 'body' areas.  If two
                                  CT's are performed on the 'head' area during the same visit, then the weighted work unit for the CT is counted only once.  The same is true for two CT's performed on the 'body' area during a visit.
