              DESCRIPTION:      CHART PHYSICAL INDEPENDENCE SCORE 
                                 
                                The CHART Physical Independence Score should be computed according to the instructions in Appendix B of the CHART Manual.  Although negative values can occur, particularly for individuals with high level cervical injuries, 
                                all scores should be in the 0 to 100 range.  If negative values occur, they should be recorded as zero (0).  In the Physical Independence dimension, a score of 100 indicates no handicap in an individual's ability to
                                sustain a customarily effective independent existence.  The need for regular or periodic assistance for activities which used to be performed independently is indicative of some degree of handicap.

                                The CHART Mobility Score should be computed according to the instructions in Appendix B of the CHART Manual yielding a score between 0 through 100.  If this computed sum is greater than 100, enter 100.  In the Mobility 
                                dimension, a score of 100 indicates no handicap in an individual's ability to move about effectively in his/her surroundings.

                                The CHART Occupation Score should be entered as a 100, if the sum of elements referred to in Appendix B of the CHART Manual is 100 or greater.  The range of scores on this scales is from 0 through 100.  In the Occupation
                                Dimension, a score of 100 indicates no handicap in an individual's ability to occupy time in the manner customary to that person's sex, age, and culture.

                                computed according to the instructions in Appendix B of the CHART Manual.  If the added sum is greater than 100, enter 100, but all scores should fall in the range between 0 through 100.

                                The CHART Economic Self-Sufficiency Score should be computed according to the instructions in Appendix B of the CHART Manual.  Since poverty levels change every year, be sure to update your poverty levels annually, by
                                referring to "Statistical Abstracts of the U.S.," "Weighted Average Poverty Levels" table, or by calling your local Census Bureau.  Make sure to make the necessary point conversions in Item # E after deriving the "D" sum. 
                                The CHART Economic Self-Sufficiency Score should be a value of either 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100.
