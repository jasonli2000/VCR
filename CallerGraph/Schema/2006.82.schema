  The Imaging Windows Sessions File (2006.82) and the Imaging Windows Workstations File (2006.81) have fields to store information about each imaging session that connects to this site.  
  The information is intended to be used to produce statistical reports, track workstation usage, Imaging version information for each workstation and more.  
  This file also tracks errors that occur during an Imaging Session, and certain actions that occur on the workstation.
