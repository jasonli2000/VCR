The purpose of this file is to satisfy the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) requirement for an electronic prescribing system to maintain an archive of all controlled substance prescriptions that were electronically entered.  
 
The file will store all the information that is considered a part of the prescription.  
 
The file should always be audited. In addition, the file should NEVER be edited using FileMan. These are both DEA requirements.  
 
In order to satisfy the requirement that both the prescribing (CPRS) and filling systems (Outpatient Pharmacy) create an archive, but to reduce the need for additional storage space, both CPRS and Pharmacy will use the same file. CPRS will create the
entries when an order is signed or when a backdoor order message is received from Pharmacy. Once Pharmacy verifies the data in the Pharmacy system is an exact match for what CPRS stored, they will subscribe to the entry in the archive file and will
update the PRESCRIPTION NUMBER (#1) field.  
 
The file was defined in a different global name in order to handle the volume set from the rest of the CPRS system (i.e., the ORDER file).  It is important to note that to fully meet the DEA requirements, the fields required by the DEA cannot be
pointers. We must store the data completely. The fields that are pointers are for our internal use, rather than for the DEA purposes.
