This file contains patient specific problems entered by the various providers of service.  The PATIENT NAME field (.02) is a backward pointer to the IHS PATIENT file.  This file contains one record for each problem for each patient, therefore, the KEY
field (.01) is duplicated.  
 
As of March 17, 1986 the FACILITY must be entered prior to the NUMBER.  If the NUMBER is entered without previously entering the FACILITY the "AA" index is created with no FACILITY pointer.

              DESCRIPTION:      VHA Unique ID (VUID) for the VHAT Concept. A unique meaningless integer assigned to a corresponding concept VHA wide.  
                                 
                                This field is being implemented to allow a more rapidly extensible vocabulary for VA, while international normative standard coding systems continue to evolve more slowly. The precise definition of the concept Polytrauma
                                may prove to be a useful example. Although the term has become common among US Military and VA physicians to describe a seriously injured (i.e., Injury Severity Score (ISS) >= 16) soldier with multiple traumatic injuries,
                                it is not yet available as a coded concept in either SNOMED CT, ICD-9-CM, or ICD-10-CM. Allowing the definition and deployment of VHAT Concept/Designation VUID pairs to identify such problems in advance of their acceptance
                                by the international medical community will help to provide coded, computable documentation in a much more timely manner than waiting for inclusion in SNOMED CT or ICD.
