This file contains patient specific problems entered by the various providers of service.  The PATIENT NAME field (.02) is a backward pointer to the IHS PATIENT file.  This file contains one record for each problem for each patient, therefore, the KEY
field (.01) is duplicated.  
 
As of March 17, 1986 the FACILITY must be entered prior to the NUMBER.  If the NUMBER is entered without previously entering the FACILITY the "AA" index is created with no FACILITY pointer.

      Short Descr:  Clinical Reminders index for ICD9 lookup.
      Description:  This cross-reference builds two indexes, one for finding all patients with a particular ICD9 code and one for finding all the ICD9 codes a patient has. The indexes are stored in the Clinical Reminders index global as: 
                     ^PXRMINDX(9000011,"ISPP",ICD9,STATUS,PRIORITY,DFN,DLM,DAS) 
                     ^PXRMINDX(9000011,"PSPI",DFN,STATUS,PRIORITY,ICD9,DLM,DAS) respectively.  
                     
                    STATUS can be "A" for active or "I" for inactive.  PRIORITY can be "A" for acute or "C" for chronic. If PRIORITY is missing then a "U" will be stored in the index.  For Problems whose PRIORITY is "C" Clinical Reminders uses today's
                    date for the date of the Problem. In all other cases Clinical Reminders uses DLM where DLM is the date last modified.  When Problems are "removed" then CONDITION is set to "H" for hidden. Hidden Problems are not indexed.  For all the
                    details, see the Clinical Reminders Index Technical Guide/Programmer's Manual.
