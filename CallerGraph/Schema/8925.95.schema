              HELP-PROMPT:      Choose the document definition to which these parameters apply. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the Document Definition to which the parameters apply.  
                                 
                                NOTE: All parameters are inherited from ancestor Classes or Document Classes, unless overridden at a subordinate level in the document definition hierarchy. (For example, if you Require Release for class Progress Notes,
                                then all progress note titles require release, unless the parameter is set to NO for a subordinate Document Class or Title.)

8925.95,.02   REQUIRE RELEASE        0;2 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      JUN 30, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether or not release is required. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter determines whether the person entering the document is required (and prompted) to release the document from a draft state upon exit from the entry/editing process.  
                                 
                                Though designed for Discharge Summaries, release may be used for any kind of TIU document.  


8925.95,.03   REQUIRE MAS VERIFICATION 0;3 SET

                                '1' FOR YES, ALWAYS; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
                                '2' FOR UPLOAD ONLY; 
                                '3' FOR DIRECT ENTRY ONLY; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether and when verification is required. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter determines whether verification by MAS is required, prior to public access and signature of the document.  
                                 
                                Though designed for Discharge Summaries, verification may be used for any kind of TIU document, and is particularly helpful for documents that are uploaded from a transcription service.  
                                 
                                Allowable values are:  0       NO 
                                                       1       YES, ALWAYS

                                                       3       DIRECT ENTRY ONLY 
                                 
                                where 1 indicates that these documents require verification regardless of how they originate; 2 indicates that verification is required only when the documents are Uploaded; and 3 indicates that verification is required
                                only when documents are entered directly into VISTA.  


8925.95,.04   REQUIRE AUTHOR TO SIGN 0;4 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      NOV 18, 2002 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether the author must sign the document. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates whether or not the author should sign the document before the expected cosigner (attending).  
                                 
                                If parameter is set to NO, only the expected cosigner is alerted for signature. Although the unsigned document appears in the author's unsigned list, and he is ALLOWED to sign it, his signature is not REQUIRED.  
                                 
                                If set to YES, then the author is alerted for signature, and if the expected cosigner should attempt to sign the document first, he is informed that the author has not yet signed.  


8925.95,.05   WHEN MAY CHART COPY BE PRINTED 0;5 POINTER TO TIU STATUS FILE (#8925.6)

              LAST EDITED:      JUN 30, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate when a chart copy may be printed. 
              DESCRIPTION:      OUT OF SERVICE.   Printing for a given status is governed by business rules.  
                                 
                                Indicate the status which a document must attain before it can be printed for the chart.  


8925.95,.06   ROUTINE PRINT EVENT(S) 0;6 SET

                                'R' FOR release; 
                                'V' FOR verification; 
                                'B' FOR both; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate on which event(s) chart copies should be printed. 
              DESCRIPTION:      A document of the given type, and of ROUTINE urgency, is automatically printed whenever one of these events occurs.  
                                 
                                For example, a site may specify that ROUTINE documents print only upon Completion (i.e., signature or cosignature), while STAT documents print upon Release from Transcription, MAS Verification, or both, in addition to
                                printing upon completion.  
                                 
                                If print events are not specified, and a CHART COPY DEVICE is defined for the Medical Center Division, then the document will be auto-printed only upon completion.  
                                 
                                If field MANUAL PRINT AFTER ENTRY is set to YES, then auto-print is ignored entirely.  
                                 
                                If urgency is not specified for some document, then its urgency is considered to be routine, and the document prints when a routine print event occurs.  


8925.95,.07   STAT PRINT EVENT(S)    0;7 SET

                                'R' FOR release; 
                                'V' FOR verification; 
                                'B' FOR both; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate the event(s) on which STAT documents will be printed. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is identical to ROUTINE PRINT EVENT(S), except that it applies to documents of STAT urgency rather than ROUTINE urgency.  


8925.95,.08   MANUAL PRINT AFTER ENTRY 0;8 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Specify whether user should be asked to print after entry. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter is used for documents where a manually-printed hard copy is desired following document entry. If the parameter is set to YES, the user is prompted to print a copy on exit from their preferred editor, and
                                auto-printing (as described in fields ROUTINE/STAT PRINT EVENT(S)) is ignored.  


8925.95,.09   ALLOW CHART PRINT OUTSIDE MAS 0;9 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether non-MAS personnel may print CHART COPIES. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field determines whether non-MAS users (for example, providers) are asked if they want WORK copies or CHART copies when they print a document.  If the field is NOT set to YES, they are not asked, and the printout is a
                                WORK copy.  
                                 
                                Generally, this is set to YES for PROGRESS NOTES, which are likely to be printed on the Ward or in the Clinic for immediate inclusion in the chart.  For DISCHARGE SUMMARIES, which are typically printed centrally, it is
                                usually set to NO, since duplicate CHART COPIES are a particular problem.  


8925.95,.1    ALLOW >1 RECORDS PER VISIT 0;10 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether the user may enter more than one of these per visit. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field determines whether a given document may be created more than once per visit.  For example, it is often appropriate to enter multiple PROGRESS NOTES for a single HOSPITALIZATION or CLINIC VISIT, whereas only one
                                DISCHARGE SUMMARY is usually entered per HOSPITALIZATION.  


8925.95,.11   ENABLE IRT INTERFACE   0;11 SET

                                '0' FOR NO; 
                                '1' FOR YES; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Please indicate whether IRT Interface should be enabled. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This enables TIU's interface with Incomplete Record Tracking (IRT), which updates IRT's deficiencies when transcription, signature, or cosignature events are registered for a given document.  
                                 
                                NOTE: IRT is designed for DISCHARGE SUMMARIES, and is appropriate only for types of documents where only one document is expected per patient movement. We therefore ask you to leave this parameter undefined (or set it to
                                NO) for PROGRESS NOTES.  


8925.95,.12   IRT DEFICIENCY         0;12 POINTER TO IRT TYPE OF DEFICIENCY FILE (#393.3)

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  S DIC("S")="I +$P(^VAS(393.3,+Y,0),U,7)" D ^DIC K DIC S DIC=DIE,X=+Y K:Y<0 X
              LAST EDITED:      DEC 06, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Please indicate the IRT DEFICIENCY that corresponds to this document 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field provides a mapping between the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION and the corresponding IRT DEFICIENCY TYPE.  For example, TIU Class DISCHARGE SUMMARY maps to IRT Deficiency Type DISCHARGE SUMMARY.  

              SCREEN:           S DIC("S")="I +$P(^VAS(393.3,+Y,0),U,7)"
              EXPLANATION:      Only TRACKED DEFICIENCIES may be selected.

8925.95,.13   DEFAULT PRINTER        0;13 POINTER TO DEVICE FILE (#3.5)

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 06, 1996 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Please select the default printer for this document. 
              DESCRIPTION:      NOT IN SERVICE.  
                                 
                                When a user prints a document of the given type and is prompted for DEVICE, this serves as the default.  


8925.95,.14   SUPPRESS DX/CPT ON ENTRY 0;14 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether to suppress Dx & CPT questions for the Visit following signature. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter applies only to documents for outpatient care. Together with parameter ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS, it determines whether or not a user is prompted for diagnoses and procedures after signing or editing a
                                document.  
                                 
                                If this parameter is set to YES (for suppress), the user is not prompted for this information. 
                                 
                                If this parameter is set to NO or is blank, the user may or may not be prompted, depending on the type of visit and on parameter ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS.  
                                 
                                If a site elects to suppress diagnoses and procedures, the site must capture this information by some other means (such as an AICS encounter form), in order to receive workload credit for these visits.  


8925.95,.15   FORCE RESPONSE TO EXPOSURES 0;15 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 08, 1999 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether a response is required on SC Classification. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                When set to YES, this parameter forces the user to respond when asked to specify a veteran's Service Connection Classification (AO, IR, or EC), when creating a standalone visit.  


8925.95,.16   ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS 0;16 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether Dx/CPT should be asked for APPOINTMENTS & STANDALONE Visits alike. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter applies only to documents for outpatient care, and is IGNORED if SUPPRESS DX/CPT ON ENTRY is set to YES.  
                                 
                                If DX/CPT prompts are NOT suppressed, and ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS is set to YES, the user is prompted for DX/CPT information for scheduled as well as unscheduled (stand-alone) visits.  
                                 
                                If DX/CPT prompts are NOT suppressed, and ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS is set to NO, the user is prompted for DX/CPT information for unscheduled visits ONLY.  


8925.95,.17   SEND ALERTS ON ADDENDA 0;17 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      DEC 05, 2002 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Should the AUTHOR (& COSIGNER) be alerted on addenda? 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter determines whether AUTHORS and COSIGNERS of a document of this kind (and any of its descendent types) will receive an informational alert when addenda are added by other persons.  
                                 
                                The addendum must be in a COMPLETED or AMENDED status for an alert to be generated.  
                                 
                                Like all document parameters, it may be overridden at descendent levels of the Document Definition Hierarchy. DEFAULT is NO.  


8925.95,.18   ORDER ID ENTRIES BY TITLE 0;18 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      To display/print interdisciplinary child entries alphabetically by title under the parent entry, answer YES.  Otherwise they are ordered by date. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This prompt applies only to notes with interdisciplinary entries under them.  
                                 
                                When an ID note is displayed or printed, the child entries are normally ordered by reference date under the parent entry. In some cases it may be preferable to order them alphabetically by title. If this parameter is set
                                to YES, child entries are displayed by title rather than by date.  
                                 
                                The default order is by date.
