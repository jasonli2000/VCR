              DESCRIPTION:      This is the earliest date that this visit can be automatically billed.  The automatic billing software will use this date when searching for events to bill.  All events with an Earliest Auto Bill Date on or before the run 
                                date of the automatic biller will be considered for inclusion on a bill.  
                                 
                                This field may be set in one of two ways.  If AUTOMATE BILLING is on for the Event Type then this field will be automatically set when apparently billable events are added to the claims tracking module.  This field can
                                also be directly set by a user, AUTOMATE BILLING does not need to be on for the Event Type.  When the automated biller runs it will attempt to add the event to a bill.  
                                 
                                This date should be deleted if the event turns out not to be suitable for a reimbursable insurance bill.  This field will automatically be deleted if the event is added to a bill or a reason not-billable is entered.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  If and only if this field is set will the event be considered by the automatic biller.  This will be set to the date the event was entered into claims tracking plus the number of days delay for the event type.  
                                 
                                Setting of this field may be automatic, ie. all by triggers, if automated billing is turned on for the event type.  Initially set by triggers on Event  Type (.18) and Date Entered (1.01).  
                                 
                                This may also be set by user.  
                                 
                                There is no checking to determine if the event is actually billable when the date is added.  Instead, if one of the fields that makes an event not billable is entered this field is deleted.

                                scheduled admissions will automatically be added to claims tracking 7 days before the scheduled admission and automatically converted to an event type of admission after the patient has been admitted.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>7!($L(X)<7) X
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 04, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This field is populated with a value sent by the ECME pkg 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the ECME NUMBER associated with the e-Pharmacy Claim. This field may only be set for e-pharmacy prescriptions and refills.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  ECME NUMBER is used to link the CT record to the ECME claim. After the ECME package successfully submitted e-Pharmacy claim it calls IB and    it creates the CT record accociated with the claim, whether it is rejected by
                                the Payer or approved. This field is especially important for the rejected e-Pharmacy claims, because IB does not create bills for rejects. The field ECME NUMBER in CT is the only means AR can recognize EOBs sent for
                                rejected claims.  

              CROSS-REFERENCE:  356^AE

                                2)= K ^IBT(356,"AE",$E(X,1,30),DA)
                                The cross-reference is important to identify CT billable episodes related to the ECME number. It will be used for EDI matching purposes.

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 19, 2006 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter "REJECTED" if the e-claim was rejected by the Payer. Enter "CLOSED" if the claim was closed by OPECC. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is a flag to mark ECME claims rejected by the Payer. The field is only meaningful if the field 1.1 "ECME NUMBER" is defined.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field will be set to "YES" when the ECME calls IB to report that the e-Pharmacy claim has been successfully submitted to the Payer, but rejected due to any reason. If the e-Pharmacy will be re-submitted and finally
                                approved by the Payer, this field will be changed to "NO".
