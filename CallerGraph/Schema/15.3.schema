This file is used to record the entry number of the FROM record that is merged into the TO record.  This can be used for FileMan to determine which entries were merged, so the IEN of the FROM record will not be reused.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates the file in which one or more entries were merged.  Whether an unused internal entry number is the result of merging an entry into another one can be determined by testing for an entry for the file 
                                number, and then under that entry an entry for the internal entry number.  If the internal entry number is present as a .01 field value in the subfile under the file number, then it is the result of merging two entries.
