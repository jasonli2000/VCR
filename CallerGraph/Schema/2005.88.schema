This file stores valid reasons (justifications) for actions performed on images: copying, printing, etc.  
 
Once a reason is referenced by a record of other file (e.g. IMAGE file (#2005)), it cannot be deleted. Use the DATE OF INACTIVATION field (.03) to exclude the reason from the list presented to the users.  
 
This file is defined by the patch MAG*3*93.

                                For example, if a reason is applicable for copying and printing, then the value of this field should be "CP".

                                Use this field to exclude records from selection without deleting them. This is especially important if inactive records are pointed to by records of other files.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter unique code of the reason (from 1 to 999999). Codes of local reasons must be preceded by letter L. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field stores the code that uniquely identifies the reason. You must not modify value of this field unless you are instructed to do so by the VistA support personnel or Imaging software developers.  
                                 
                                "Standard" reasons (i.e. those distributed with the Imaging software) have numeric codes. 
                                 
                                Codes of "local" reasons created by the users at the sites consist from record IENs preceded by letter L (e.g. "L12").  
                                 
                                When a new record is created, this field is automatically pre-populated with a "local" code.

     This input template is used by the MAG REASON 
     EDIT option to add/edit records of the MAG REASON 
     file (#2005.88). The template does not allow 
     editing of standard records distributed with the 
     Imaging application. These records can only be 
     inactivated if necessary.
