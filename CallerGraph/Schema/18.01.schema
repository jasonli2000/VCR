              HELP-PROMPT:      Type the number of seconds between 180 and 3600 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates the rate (in seconds) the VistALink heartbeat message should be expected from a client. If there is no activity on the connection for this amount of time, the client will send a system heartbeat
                                message.  
                                 
                                The client, as part of the initial connection protocol, retrieves this value. As a result, the client and the M server are always synchronized regarding the heartbeat rate.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type the number of seconds between 180 and 3600 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates the number of seconds to add to the HEARTBEAT RATE when calculating the initial timeout value for the VistALink Listener.  
                                 
                                The client and the M server are synchronized regarding the HEARTBEAT RATE. This latency parameter allows the site to fine tune the timeout value. The site can to take into account any network slowness or other factors that
                                may delay the arrival of the system heartbeat message from the client.

18.01,.04     J2EE CONNECTION TIMEOUT 0;4 NUMBER

              LAST EDITED:      NOV 16, 2004 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the number of seconds between 180 (3 minutes) and 604800 (1 week), inclusive. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates the number of seconds that a VistaLink connection from J2EE to M should be allowed to remain connected but inactive, before M drops the connection.  
                                 
                                It is recommended that this J2EE CONNECTION TIMEOUT parameter be set relatively high, for example 1 day (86400 seconds).  
                                 
                                A high setting is recommended because all the major application server implementations have more robust mechanisms for controlling connection pools. The site should use the tools/mechanisms supplied by the application
                                server implementation to control how the connection pool size grows and shrinks.  
                                 
                                For a quick indicator of the level of control available, below is a brief summary of the connection pool properties in the J2EE deployment descriptors (DD) for J2EE Connector Architecture (J2CA) adaptors by the major
                                application servers.

              DESCRIPTION:      Number of seconds a connection is considered reauthenicated after a successful reauthentication has occurred.

                                - If a connection in the application server's pool is not 
                                  reused by the reauthenticated user before this timeout 
                                  limit is reached, the reauthentication is considered expired.  
                                 
                                - If expiration does occur, the re-authentication process is 
                                  performed again.  
                                 
                                - If expiration does not occur, the session is considered 
                                  reauthenticated for these number of seconds. (i.e. the time 
                                  out clock is reset)

                                  connection is immediately considered not reauthenticated and 
                                  the reauthentication process is performed.

                                 - User gains access and uses a connection from the pool at 4:00pm 
                                 - User signs off and goes home, along with most of the site staff 
                                 - After 4:00pm, user file maintenance is performed and 
                                   the user's profile is changed. For example, the user's 
                                   FILE MANAGER ACCESS CODE [DUZ(0)] is changed.  
                                 - User signs back on the next morning at 8am 
                                 - Since there is very little activity from 4:00-8am, the connection 
                                   has not been re-used by another user and is still associated with 
                                   4:00 user 
                                 - Since timeout has passed, reauthentication has expired 
                                 - Reauthentication process occurs for user 
                                 - Reauthentication process re-sets DUZ(0) appropriately to new value.

                                Each configuration is used by the XOBV LISTENER STARTUP menu option. This option is typically scheduled to run as part of the system startup after the VistA system has been restarted. The option will start up VistALink

                                Note: This only applies to Cache NT systems. VMS/DSM systems need to use the TCP/IP (UCX) utility to have Listeners automatically started on reboot.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the default configuration name 
                DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates the default startup Listener configuration for the BOX-VOLUME PAIR entry.  
                                   
                                  The XOBV LISTENER STARTUP option uses this field to retrieve the correct Listener configuration from the VISTALINK LISTENER CONFIGURATION file (#18.03).  
                                   
                                  The information in the configuration is then used to start up the indicated VistALink Listeners on the desired ports.

                                  Note: This only applies to Cache NT systems. VMS/DSM systems need to use the TCP/IP (UCX) utility to have Listeners automatically started on reboot.
