This file contains the diagnostic codes that can be associated with an exam.  The code is attached to an exam at the same time the interpreting resident and/or staff physician is entered for the exam. The diagnostic code represents a quick overall
summary of what the interpreting physician wrote in his/her report concerning the exam. [NOTE: Diagnostic code is not the impression. The impression is stored in the 'IMPRESSION' field of the 'RAD/NUC MED REPORTS' file (#74).] 
 
The following is the list of codes that are loaded when the module is initialized: 
 
         1) NORMAL 
         2) MINOR ABNORMALITY 
         3) MINOR ABNORMALITY, NO ATTN, NEEDED 
         4) ABNORMALITY, ATTN. NEEDED 
         5) MAJOR ABNORMALITY, PHYSICIAN AWARE 
         6) UNDICTATED FILMS NOT RETURNED, 3 DAYS 
         7) UNSATISFACTORY/INCOMPLETE EXAM 
         8) POSSIBLE MALIGNANCY, FOLLOW-UP NEEDED 
 
As part of the system customization process, these entries can be deleted.  However, once the system is in production, you should 'not' delete any entries. Adding new entries is always allowed.  
 
If the site decides to enter diagnostic codes for exams, then database searches can be performed using the 'DIAGNOSTIC CODE' field of the exam record in the search criteria. For example, the database can be searched for all 'normal' chest procedures.  
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
The data for the 'DIAGNOSTIC CODES' file is stored in the ^RA(78.3, global. At the present time this file is very static after day-one initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.  It should also be translated if the operating
system supports this function.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains a short diagnostic code to indicate the results of the interpreting physician's analysis of the images.  Diagnostic codes can be between 3 and 60 characters in length and can be used as a basis for
                                database searches.  (ie. How many 'Normal' chest exams were performed during a specific time period?) 
                                 
                                Eight diagnostic codes are included with the original package.  Other site-specific diagnostic codes may be entered by the rad/nuc med coordinator at each site.

                                Patch RA*5.0*97 adds BI-RADS codes to IEN 1100 thru 1106, and AAA codes to IEN 1200 thru 1202.  Routine RABIRAD builds a string of BI-RADS IENs based upon the exact spelling of the first two words in this field, eg.  
                                "BI-RADS CATEGORY".

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains a 'Yes' or 'No' value to indicate if exams with this diagnostic code should be printed on the 'Abnormal Exam Report'.  The report is used to ensure that the physician is notified of abnormal results of
                                an exam.  This field must be set to 'Yes' before the diagnostic code is entered on the exam in order for that exam to appear on the 'Abnormal Exam Report'.
