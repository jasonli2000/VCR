This file is used to define all of the components that work together to define a reminder dialog. Reminder dialog definitions are used by the CPRS GUI for reminder resolution.  
 
This file contains a combination of nationally distributed entries, local auto-generated entries, site and VISN exchanged entries and local manually created entries. Nationally distributed dialog, element, and group entries have their name prefixed with
VA-. Nationally distributed Prompts, Forced Value, Result Groups, and Result Elements have their name prefixed with PXRM. Entries in this file may be auto-generated via the Dialog Management Menu option. Manually created dialog entries should use local 
namespacing conventions. Nationally distributed entries will have their class type defined as National. Entries created at the VISN level should be defined as VISN and entries created at a site should be defined as Local.  
 
This file is similar to the option file where there are different types of entries (reminder dialog, dialog elements (sentences), prompts, and groups of elements, result elements and groups of result elements). Where an option has menu items, the dialog
file has components that are entered, with the sequence field as the .01 field. 
 
A prompt is defined for PCE prompts, WH Notification Purpose, or as locally created comment check-boxes. The prompts will not have any components within them. PXRM-prefixed prompts are distributed in this file with the Clinical Reminder package.  
 
A dialog element is defined primarily to represent sentences to display in the CPRS window with a check-box. When the user checks the sentence off, the FINDING ITEM in the dialog element and the ADDITIONAL FINDINGS will be added to the list of PCE
updates, orders, WH Notification Purposes, and mental health tests. The updates won't occur on the CPRS GUI until the user clicks on the FINISH button. Dialog elements may have components added to them. Auto-generated components will be based on the
additional prompts defined in the Finding Type Parameters. Once a dialog element is auto-generated, the sites can modify them.  
 
Dialog elements may also be instructional text or a header. The FINDING ITEM and components would not be defined in dialog elements.  
 
A dialog group is similar to menu options. It groups dialog elements and dialog groups within its component multiple. The dialog group can be defined with a finding item and a check-box. The components in the group can be hidden from the CPRS GUI window
until the dialog group is checked off. 
 
A result element contains special logic that uses information entered during the resolution process to create a sentence to add to the progress note. The special logic contains a CONDITION that, when true, will use the ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXT field
to update the progress note. A separate result element is used for each separate sentence needed. The result element is only used with mental health test finding items. Default result elements are distributed for common mental health tests, prefixed with
PXRM and the mental health test name. Sites may copy them and modify their local versions as needed.  
 
A result group contains all of the result elements that need to be checked to create sentences for one mental health test finding. The dialog element for the test will have its RESULT GROUP/ELEMENT field defined with the result group. Default result
groups for mental health tests are distributed with the Clinical Reminders package. Sites may copy them and modify their local versions as needed.  
 
Sites should name locally created items according to their local naming convention.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a 3-64 character name to represent this dialog entry. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the name of the dialog entry. 
                                 
                                Dialogs that are auto-generated from a reminder will default to the name of the reminder for ease in identifying the reminder dialog entry. Dialog elements that are auto-generated use the following naming convention:  
                                Finding type prefix_ _Name from finding file_ _Resolution Status. Examples of two dialog element entry names generated from an Exam file entry for DIABETIC EYE EXAM follow.

                                Any item created locally can use any type of naming convention. Your site may want to create special namespacing for dialog entries that you create locally. 
                                 
                                Entries prefixed with PXRM are prompts, result groups, and result elements that were distributed with the Clinical Reminders package. The PXRM-prefixed prompts are the additional prompts that can be asked for particular
                                types of PCE findings and WH Notification Purpose. For example: PXRM COMMENT can be added to any PCE file to allow the user to enter an additional COMMENT beyond the dialog element's progress note text, and the PXRM LEVEL
                                OF UNDERSTANDING can only be used with PCE Education Topic findings.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Specify a type for this entry. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field defines what type of dialog component this entry is. The type determines the processing that can occur with this entry. 
                                 
                                Reminder dialogs are the dialog entries that can be mapped to a reminder definition. Reminder dialogs will typically contain several dialog elements and/or dialog groups. 
                                 
                                Dialog elements that are auto-generated represent a finding item and resolution status combination, based on the Finding Type Parameters for auto-generation. The dialog elements can be defined manually if needed. Dialog
                                elements must have the FINDING ITEM field defined in order to cause the finding to be updated automatically. When no finding item is defined, the dialog element is treated as a header or instruction text in the CPRS GUI.
                                Sites can also add Additional Finding items to automatically update when a dialog element is checked off. An example of using the additional finding would be for a dialog element for a diagnosis, that must always be
                                recorded with a second diagnosis.  Another example is when an Exam or Education Topic dialog element checked off should automatically add an additional ICD9 and/or CPT finding to PCE.  
                                 
                                Dialog elements will use the DIALOG/PROGRESS NOTE TEXT to display in the CPRS GUI window. This text will also be added to the progress note, unless the optional ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXT field is defined. If the dialog
                                text to display to the user needs to be different from the text to add to the progress note, use the ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXT field to define the progress note text.  
                                 
                                Dialog Groups can be used to group dialog elements together. Groups can be displayed with a box around them and have selection rules applied to them (e.g., select one, one or more)  A dialog element can be changed to a
                                dialog group by changing its TYPE.  Prompts are distributed in the PXRM namespace to represent additional fields that the user can enter when an element is checked off. Prompts are added to dialog elements during
                                auto-generation based on the finding type parameters. The PXRM COMMENT field is a generic comment field that can be used on all PCE related finding items. Dialog elements for "DONE ELSEWHERE" need to require the historical
                                visit date prompt. The forced value is similar to a prompt, except it represents a stuffed prompt which doesn't need to be presented to answer. The PXRM prompts can be copied for local modification to create additional 
                                forced value entries if necessary.  
                                 
                                Prompts created locally (not copies of PXRM prompts) are treated as display text with checkboxes, which, when checked off, add text to a comment field which is added to the progress note text. Refer to these as Local
                                Comment Prompts.  
                                 
                                Result Groups and Result Elements are distributed in the PXRM namespace and are associated with Mental Health Instrument finding items during auto-generation of a reminder dialog. When the mental health instrument finding
                                item dialog element is selected by the CPRS GUI user, a window will be opened which contains the test's questions and probable answers.  The selected answers are sent to the mental health package when the user selects OK.
                                The mental health package returns the score and results which can be used within sentences. These sentences are defined as Result Elements, and can vary depending on the test score. If multiple sentences are possible
                                depending on the score, the result elements should be defined in a result group. The result group should be added to the mental health test's dialog elements RESULT GROUP/ELEMENT field. Mental Health tests for use by
                                Mental Health clinicians only are not available for CPRS reminder resolution.  
                                 
                                A reminder dialog can be made into a dialog group and added to another reminder's dialog. This allows multiple reminders to be addressed by one reminder dialog.  
                                 
                                Reminder Dialogs can include dialog elements that don't have anything to do with the findings defined in the reminder.  
                                 
                                Taxonomy dialogs are auto-generated based on the Taxonomy Dialog Parameters. The taxonomy dialog can be used as a black box that allows the users to enter current or historical encounter diagnoses or procedures, based on
                                the selectable list of diagnosis parameters. Alternatively, a taxonomy can have individual dialog elements created for each coded value in the selectable list of diagnoses and procedures. It may be more useful for sites to
                                create dialog elements for the common diagnoses and procedures they actively use and add them to groups, similar to the encounter form section and coded value groupings.

              LAST EDITED:      JUL 31, 2007 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value defined in this field is used to control whether or not a mental health (MH) test is required to open from the reminder dialog, and whether the test must be completed before the reminder dialog can be finished in
                                CPRS.  
                                 
                                If the value is 0, the user is not required to select/open the MH test before the reminder dialog can be finished. 
                                 
                                If the value is 1, the user is required to select/open and complete the MH test in the reminder dialog before the reminder dialog can be finished. 
                                 
                                If the value is 2, the user is not required to select/open the MH test in the reminder dialog; however, if the user opens the MH test, then the user is required to complete or Cancel the MH test before the reminder dialog
                                can be finished. 
                                 
                                Clicking Cancel in the MH test dialog is considered the same as not opening the MH test.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is a pointer to file 811.5. If a reminder term is defined in this field when the dialog is loaded by CPRS, the reminder term will be evaluated. The Reminder Term evaluation will return either a True of False 
                                value. The value returned by the Reminder Term evaluation is used in conjunction with the Reminder Term Status field.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used in conjunction with the Reminder Term field. It will be used to determine if a Reminder Dialog Element/Group should do a special action. When the Reminder Term is defined in field #116, the True/False 
                                result of the term evaluation will be compared to the value defined in this field. If the value matches the dialog, it will complete the action defined in field #118. If the reminder term evaluation value does not match
                                the value defined in this field, the default action of the element/group is loaded into CPRS.
