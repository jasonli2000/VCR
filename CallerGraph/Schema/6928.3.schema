A simple file of physical buildings. A 'division designation' may be included if needed to distinguish between two buildings having the same number. Suppose, for example, there were two buildings numbered 100 at VAMC St. Louis, one at the John Cochran
Division and one at Jefferson Barracks. These two buildings could be entered separately as 100-JC and 100-JB; where 'JB' and 'JC' are division designators. The same strategy may be useful at facilities that support outpatient clinics, Regional Offices,
national cemeteries, etc.

              HELP-PROMPT:      ANSWER MUST BE 1-10 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH, NO MORE THAN ONE HYPHEN 
              DESCRIPTION:       Building identifier. Used for data validation when entries are made in the Space File. Building NAME should consist of either one or two pieces, separated by the hyphen ("-"). The rule is this: 
                                   1. Sites where building designations are unique in and 
                                   of themselves should have one-piece entries in this file.  
                                   Building NAME's should not contain any hyphens.  
                                   2. Sites where building designations are not necessarily 
                                   unique (multi-division sites and perhaps sites that support 
                                   remote clinics and/or other quasi-independent offices) 
                                   should use a two-piece format. The second piece should 
                                   designate the division, outpatient clinic, Regional Office, 
                                   etc. Building NAME's should contain only one hyphen, which 
                                   will be treated as the delimiter between 'building' and 
                                   'division'.  
                                 Building NAME's should be kept as short as possible since they will be printed on each bar coded LOCATION LABEL. It will be difficult to fit lengthy building NAME's onto bar code labels of standard size. Assuming three
                                inch width and Code 39 symbology, bar coded LOCATION LABEL's can accomodate about thirteen (13) characters total. In particular, it is suggested that 'division' designations be no more than two or three characters long.
