This file contains consult and request orders originating primarily via the OE/RR ordering process.  Once the order exists in this file, receiving service users perform update tracking activities.  An audit trail of the update tracking activities is
maintained in this file.  
  
The only associating of results to a consult or request, for this version, is based on Medicine Package procedure results.
