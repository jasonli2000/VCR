                                On a parameter-controlled frequency, a master job is run to determine whether individual monitors should be run.  When these master jobs start, an entry is made in the HL Event Master Job file (#776.2).   The .01 field of
                                this file is Creation Time, and this B xref is created based on the date/time value in this field.
