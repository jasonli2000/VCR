              DESCRIPTION:       This field is no longer used to control reporting of clinic stop codes.  The PCE package has replaced the  clinic stop codes with CPT codes for each test collected. You should now use PCE/VSIT ON (#615) in LABORATORY SITE
                                (#69.9) file to control both clinic stop code and CPT code transmission. Patch LR*5.2*127 automatically sets the PCE/VSIT ON field to report both clinic stop and CPT codes. It expected that beginning with Oct. 1, 1996 VA
                                DHCP will begin reporting workload using CPT codes. Logic has been built into the software to determine when to start reporting CPT codes to the PCE package.  
                                 
                                This field will be retired in future version.
