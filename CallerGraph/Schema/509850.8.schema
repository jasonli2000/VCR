The A&SP SITE PARAMETERS file (#509850.8) contains site specific data used by the QUASAR package.  There should be only ONE site entry in this file.  
  
Before running the package, at least one Division must be added to the file and at least one Clinic entered for the Division.  
  
The INTERFACE TO PCE and SEND TO PCE parameters control whether visit data is sent to PCE. If the INTERFACE TO PCE is set to YES then the overnight job to send data to PCE will be active. It will send visit data for any Division that has the SEND TO PCE
field set to YES.  
  
Each Division has a USE ASP CLINIC FILE NUMBER field which allows you to associate existing clinic file numbers with patients. You can also activate the AMIE C&P Interface for specific Divisions and specify that when entering data for a Division the user
is not required to enter Audiometric data for Hearing Loss cases by setting the BYPASS AUDIOMETRICS parameter to YES.  
  
  
Data in this file SHOULD NOT be altered through the use of VA FileMan; input should take place ONLY through the QUASAR menu options.  
  
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition SHOULD NOT be modified.

              DESCRIPTION:       This field determines whether Quasar will interface with the PCE package.  If you answer YES then Quasar will attempt to send visit data to PCE whenever a visit is entered or edited. It will also delete visit data from
                                PCE if the corresponding QUASAR visit is deleted.  
                                 
                                If you wish QUASAR to send visit data to PCE then you must also set the SEND TO PCE parameter to YES for the appropriate Division or Divisions.

                DESCRIPTION:      If you are a single division site, enter your division here and all workload will be credited to your division.  
                                   
                                  If you are a multi-divisional site you must enter each division here and when entering a visit you will be asked to select the division in which the visit took place. This allows the workload to be credited to the 
                                  correct divisions.  
                                   
                                  You must enter at least one Division for your site.

                                  Both the INTERFACE TO PCE parameter for the Site, and the SEND TO PCE parameter for a Division, must be set to YES if you wish QUASAR to transmit Visit data to PCE for the Division.

                DESCRIPTION:      The USE C&P field allows you to use the QUASAR - AMIE/C&P interface for data transmission. If you answer YES to this field, you can enter all C&P exam information contained on the AMIE worksheet, adequate the results,
                                  and hand-off the report to the AMIE/C&P package. If your station does not support the AMIE package (e.g., reports are typed or dictated for transcription), you should answer NO to this question.

                LAST EDITED:      JAN 12, 1999 
                HELP-PROMPT:      Do you want to give users the ability to bypass the entry of audiometric data during data entry sessions? 
                DESCRIPTION:      Certain diagnosis codes (i.e., hearing loss codes) are flagged to require audiometric data to be entered when those codes are used for a visit. If a visit contains one of the flagged codes, users are generally forced to
                                  enter the audiometric data.  
                                   
                                  By answering YES for the BYPASS AUDIOMETRICS field, you allow users to bypass the entry of the audiometric data. If you answer NO, users are not given the bypass option and audiometric data is required if flagged codes
                                  are used.  
                                   
                                  In any case, if the exam is a C&P exam, audiometric data is required.
