              DESCRIPTION:      This field is maintained by the OE/RR version 3 conversion.  If the conversion is in the background job, this will keep track of the stage of the background process it is on.  Once the background job is complete, this
                                field will be deleted.  The stages are:

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-30 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is maintained by the OE/RR orders conversion.  If the background job process is running, this will keep track of the last value processed for the current stage.  If the background job stops and needs to be
                                restarted, this field will allow restart from where the process left off.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is maintained by the OE/RR orders conversion.  If the conversion is in the background job portion, this field will contain the task number (ZTSK) of the background process job.  This will assist in providing the
                                status of the job and allowing restart should the job stop.

              DESCRIPTION:      Should you wish to stop the background job process for any reason during the OE/RR version 3.0 orders conversion, you can call STOP^OR3CONV and this field will be set to yes.  The conversion will check for this field and
                                when it finds it set, it will allow the conversion to make a clean stop.  RESTART^OR3CONV may be used to restart the task.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is the default menu used to add orders.  If this field has no entry, then the ORADD menu will be used as the default.  This field is for sites that wish to customize the ORADD menu by creating another menu in a
                                local namespace (ORZADD) so that local changes won't be overwritten when new versions of OE/RR are installed.  When a customized menu structure has been created for local use of OE/RR, it should be put in this field.  
                                 
                                Starting with Version II of OE/RR, menus can be set up in file 101 for specific users or groups of users and assigned on an individual basis via the Clinical Coordinators menu.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field is used as a default display group for orders created by this package.  If the variable ORTO is not defined correctly when creating the order, this default will be used.  This is ultimately used in reporting
                                  for grouping related orders via relationships found in the DISPLAY GROUP file.

                                  initialization routines created by ORVOM can then be run at the time of package initialization to set up these protocols.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field controls the listing of lab orders for holders of the ORES key, after the electronic signature has been entered when entering new orders.  If Physicians want to see the lab order # with the order after entering
                                and signing the orders, this parameter must be set to YES. The Lab Order # is not displayed on the new orders screen.  Only after the order is released to Lab service is the number assigned.  All other users get the
                                listing regardless of what this parameter is set to.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field allows electronic signature functionality to be used.  Use of this functionality requires some initial setup before it can be turned on.  Users have to be assigned keys that allow them to perform verification
                                steps in the order entry process.  They also have to be given an electronic signature code.  This also has an effect on who can be selected as the person requesting the order.

              LAST EDITED:      MAY 24, 1996 
              DESCRIPTION:      A site can use this field to select 1 of 4 modes for Electronic Signature: 0>No change from current Electronic Signature functionality.  1>Yes  All orders must be signed online.  Signature on chart is not allowed All
                                orders are filed initially with a signature status of Unsigned and a notification for electronic signature is sent to the ordering provider.  2>Yes (Allow S.O.C)  All orders are signed online, but for those cases where an
                                order is written and signed on the paper chart, you can so specify.  Backdoor orders send a notification for electronic signature and require a signature, unless the order has a Nature of Order set to null.  3>Yes (Allow
                                S.O.C. & Written)  Is the same as option 2 except that it will allow orders sent from the ancillary packages with a nature of order of Written to be entered without requiring an electronic signature.  4>Yes (Exempt Service
                                Entered)  Is the same as option 2 except that it will allow orders sent from the ancillary packages that have not defined a nature of order to be entered without requiring an electronic signature.  This is the way
                                'backdoor' orders were handled before the changes introduced with this new field (added with patch OR*2.5*46) were added.  As of the release of patch OR*2.5*46 only Pharmacy and Lab have a way of dealing with the nature of
                                order from the backdoor.  So until the rest of the backdoor interfaces can deal with this, option 4 is the least disruptive method of evolution, and still get the enhancements for notification and signing of verbal orders.  
                                   
                                For options 1,2,3 & 4, the default for the prompt "Do you want to mark these orders as 'Signed on Chart'" is changed to NO.

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 15, 1996 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field controls the type of review screen that is used for new/unsigned orders. Without this parameter, the user has to sign all orders when entering new orders or presented with new /unsigned orders when leaving the
                                review screen.  Setting this parameter to 1 (Select) will force the use of the standard review screen of unsigned orders.  This 'new' screen allow the user to select the order sign by number, range of numbers or all orders
                                by entering the keyword "all" 
                                  
                                If a site sets the UNSIGNED ORDERS SCREEN parameter to Select, the default prompt for all users will be 'Accept Orders'.  This default can be overridden for physicians (holders of the ORES key), by appropriately setting a
                                new parameter, NEW ORDERS DEFAULT - PROVIDER to 1 - SIGN & RELEASE.

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 11, 1996 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This parameter determines the default prompt for providers when the UNSIGNED ORDERS SCREEN parameter is set to SELECT.  The default is ACCEPT ORDERS.

                                option will check cross references in file 100 for accuracy.  The ORE LAB ORDER CLEANUP (Clean-up Lab Orders in OE/RR and Lab files) option will check for inconsistencies between OR/RR and Lab files and attempts to correct
                                them.  The Lab Order clean-up utility on the ORE MGR menu looks at LAPSE DAYS to decide when to put pending lab orders with old start dates in a lapsed state.  Orders with a Lapsed status (l) are no longer shown in the
                                current orders context.  Another parameters is being exported called LAST LAB CLEAN-UP.  This holds the last ORIFN that was processed during the last clean-up, and is used as a default number to start with the next time
                                the option is run.
