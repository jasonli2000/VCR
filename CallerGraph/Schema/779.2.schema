This file is used to register sending and receiving applications for HL7 messaging. For receiving applications, the process of registration consists of registering what messages the application is prepared to receive.  
 
For both sending and receiving applications, it is necessary to specify what package the application belongs to.  For sending applications, that is the only field that applies, other than the name of the sending application.  
 
An application can be either a sender or a receiver of messages, or both. In order for an application to receive messages, it must specify an action (M tag^routine) for each type of message that it is capable of receiving, or a default action that
applies when no messsage-specific action is defined.

              HELP-PROMPT:      If your application requires its own listener (HIGHLY DISCOURAGED), enter it here. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Applications are highly discouraged from establishing their own listeners.  The use of the multi-listeners provide concurrent processing of many connections over the same port, so a dedicated listener will not provide an
                                application with a performance boost, while it will cause the site additional work to maintain. So before establishing a dedicated listener, the application developer should verify the need.
