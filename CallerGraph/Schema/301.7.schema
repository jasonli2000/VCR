The IVM ADDRESS CHANGE LOG file contains the patient's prior address information when the address has been updated.  
 
A record will be created when the address is updated from either the upload of an ORU~Z05 Demographic (Address) HL7 Transmission or from manual data entry using any of the following options:  DG ADDRESS UPDATE, DG REGISTER PATIENT, DGPRE PRE-REGISTER
OPTION, and DG LOAD PATIENT DATA.  
 
The previous address information found in the PATIENT File #2 will be stored along with the Date/Time the address was changed, the Source of the change, and User ID of the person who made the change.  In the case of an update via an ORU~Z05, the User ID
will be POSTMASTER.
