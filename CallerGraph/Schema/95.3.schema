              DESCRIPTION:      Note: the data contained in this field contains some incorrect values due to errors in LOINC released database. When check digit computation errors are discovered - STATUS (#20) field is marked as DEL preventing the code 
                                from being assigned. Once a LOINC has be released it never deleted from the database.  
                                 
                                 
                                This field contains the LOINC number modulo 10 check digit.  The instruction for calculating a Mod 10 check digit is as follows: (1) Take the odd digit positions counting from the right (2) Multiply by 2 (3) Take the even
                                digits starting from the right (4) Append these to the front of the results of (2) (5) Add the digits of (4) together (6) Find the next highest multiple of 10 (7) Subtract (5) from (6)
