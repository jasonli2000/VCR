For each event association (or event type) statistics are automatically store each time the event is triggered.  Statistics are grouped by date and event type.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                Number representing the number of times the event was triggered for the date specified in the date field.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>9999999)!(X<0)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      MAR 07, 1996 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 0 and 9999999, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This represents the number of errors that were encountered while trying to process an event.  Since events can be re-processed after an error condition is corrected, the number of errors and number of events successfully
                                processed can be greater than the number of total events.  
                                 
                                For example: If a single event attempted to run and had an error and was reprocessed successfully, the number of errors would be one and the number processed would be one.  If you totaled these two fields it would equal
                                two, but this represents only one occurrence of an event.
