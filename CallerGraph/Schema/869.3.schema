              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the Domain Name of this environment 
              DESCRIPTION:      The domain name for this environment must be unique to all environments running at your site. For example, if your production domain is SITE.MED.VA.GOV and this is your test system, you must have an entry in your domain
                                file that is different such as TEST.SITE.MED.VA.GOV.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the default PROCESSING ID for this account. 
              DESCRIPTION:      What type of environment is this account? The messaging system will not permit messages to be sent from one type of environment to a different type. The third Processing ID used by HL7 is DEBUG. This mode must be defined
                                on the EVENT DRIVER protocol on both the sending and receiving systems.  
                                 
                                An error will be logged when the PID for an inbound message is inappropriate for the receiving system.  
                                 
                                Note: Ideally, TRAINING and PRODUCTION designations are maintained in separate accounts. Application processing routines should be aware of the PID field when processing a message. Routines designed for a production 
                                environment will probably want to process messages differently when TRAINING or DEBUG mode is set.
