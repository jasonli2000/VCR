The ROR REPORT PARAMETERS file stores the report definitions that are used by the ROR REPORT SCHEDULE remote procedure to schedule the reports.  
 
Records of the file are uniquely identified by the report code (the "A" primary key and the uniqueness index "KEY" are used for that purpose).

                                The CODE field stores the unique code of the report.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The corresponding XSL templates for the report are stored in the DIALOG file (#.84). The dialog number of the template has the following structure:

                                 'CCC' is the code of the report.  
                                 
                                 'TTT' is the type of the template: 
                                        001 - HTML Preview, 
                                        002 - Delimited Format (CSV), 
                                        003 - Printer Output.  
                                 
                                For example, the dialog 7981001.001 contains the HTML preview template for the List of Registry Patients (report code: 1).  
                                 
                                If no template is defined for the report then the default template from dialog 7981000 is used.
