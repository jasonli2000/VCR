              DESCRIPTION:      If the field value is NULL the nightly DMC job will prevent the debt from being referred to DMC when the debtor is SC 50% to 100% or in Receipt of a VA Pension. It will then set this field value to PENDING so the users 
                                will know this is what occurred.  
                                 
                                If a user sets this field value to YES and the debt meets all criteria to be sent to DMC it will be referred to DMC even if the debtor is SC 50% to 100% or in Receipt of a VA Pension.  
                                 
                                If a user sets this value to NO the debt will not be referred to DMC.  
                                 
                                Users should only interactively be able to set the value to YES or NO. PENDING is reserved for the nightly DMC job.
