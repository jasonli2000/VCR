              DESCRIPTION:      This flag is temporary.  Currently, during Fiscal Obligation processing, the unobligated balance is displayed online.  To get this figure, the system adds up all transactions (2237's) from file 410 for the fiscal year,
                                quarter and control point of the current obligation.  This can be very time consuming near the end of a quarter.  This function will allow Fiscal to 'turn off' the display, so that the obligation will work faster.  We plan
                                to find a quicker way to display the balance, at which time this flag will be deleted from the file.
