              DESCRIPTION:      This is the code that will be xecuted to format the 'raw' data element value that is returned from the execution of the DATA ELEMENT's definition.  This code can assume the variable/array IBXDATA is available as input and 
                                should set this variable/array as its output.  Standard calls for data formatting have been provided.  The variables IBXPG, IBXLN, IBXCOL are the only IBX* variables that should be changed in this routine.  These represent 
                                the page, line, column as the first 3 levels of subscript for the output array.
