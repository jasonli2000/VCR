The DSM (#627.7) file holds the DSM-III codes originally stored in the DSM3 (#627) file, DSM-III-R codes originally stored in the DSM-III-R (#627.5) file, and DSM-IV diagnostic codes.  In addition, it will hold all codes created be DSM versions following
IV.  Each entry is unique to a DSM version (even if entries are identical) and is identified by the DSM VERSION field.

              DESCRIPTION:      When the DSM file (#627.7) was originally created, all entries in the DSM3 (#627) and DSM-III-R (#627.5) files were copied into this file.  When that was done, the internal entry number (IEN) of the DSM3 or DSM-III-R entry
                                was recorded in the SOURCE IEN field. The data contained in this field will be permanently maintained; even after the source files - DSM3 and DSM-III-R - have been deleted.  This field holds the internal entry number (IEN)
                                of the DSM3 (#627) or DSM-III-R (#627.5) entry which served as the source for the corresponding entry in this file.  
                                 
                                Note: This field will be blank for DSM-IV entries, and all entries created for future DSM versions.

              DESCRIPTION:      After a diagnosis is selected, additional "modifying" or "qualifying" information can be entered by the user.  These are referred to as either "modifiers" or "qualifiers", and these are placed in the QUALIFIER STRING
                                multiple.  
                                 
                                Note:  When entering diagnosis, usually, a list of qualifiers is displayed for user selection.  User responses are recorded in the Diagnostic Results - Mental Health (#627.8) file.  However, at times qualifiers are used to
                                provide information to the users - only.  For example, after selecting some diagnosis the user will see a message stating "Also code 046.1 Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease on Axis III".  After the display of message, no user
                                response is requested; diagnosis entry continues.
