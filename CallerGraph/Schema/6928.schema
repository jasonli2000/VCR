              DESCRIPTION:      Identifier of a physical location (room). With the advent of bar coding, it is essential that this field uniquely and unambiguously specify a particular location. Entries may consist of one, two, or three pieces.  Hyphens
                                (if present) are treated as delimiters between pieces. First piece (always present) is room designation, second piece (optional) is building designation, and third piece (optional) is division designation (may be used for
                                outpatient clinics, regional offices, etc.  as well as for formal divisions).  
                                 
                                It is anticipated that most sites will use two piece entries. True single-building facilities may use one-piece entries. Multi-division facilities and sites supporting remote offices where duplicate building numbers may be
                                a problem should use three-piece entries.  
                                 
                                Entry of a two-piece ROOM NUMBER will autoamtically populate the BUILDING field. Entry of a three-piece ROOM NUMBER will automatically populate the BUILDING and DIVISION fields.  
                                 
                                Hyphens must not be used as anything other than delimiters between ROOM, BUILDING, and DIVISION.
