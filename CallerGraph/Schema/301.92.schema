                                This cross-reference is used as lookup for all the demographic fields sent by the IVM Center.  The internal entry number for the demographic field is also pointed to from the DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD DATA sub-sub file (#301.511) 
                                which is located in the IVM PATIENT (#301.5) file.  This pointer is stored with the value of the demographic element transmitted by the IVM Center.

                                All of these fields will be flagged in the "AD" cross reference.  The cross reference will be utilized during the Demographics upload to determine if an 'address' field is being uplaoded.

                                This cross-reference is used to build a list of all uploadable fields which must be filed in order to file a complete and valid new address.  The cross-reference is used during the demographics upload to determine if a
