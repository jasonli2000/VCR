Our customer Service Standards were developed by listening to our customers--the patients who daily come to us expecting the highest quality care and services available.  You told us that the following 10 areas were the most important to you.  We have
turned those areas into standards that you can expect us to meet.  Whenever we don't meet them, you can expect us to improve until we do.  We want you to choose to come to the VA for all your health care needs.
