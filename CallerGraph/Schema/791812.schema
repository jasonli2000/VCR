The Transmission Batch File contains individual batches of orders with pointers to all orders that have been grouped in that batch for transmission to the DDC. The file contains information specific to each batch, such as the status of the batch and the
pointer to the transmission message. This is a dynamic file whose entries are deleted as part of the purge process when all orders in the batch are no longer active.  
 
When a transmission batch is closed, all information needed by the DDC for each order is gathered and stored in the Transmission Batch File in the exact format that is sent in the mail message to the DDC. This information is stored in the "H" node of the
file which is a non-standard node. The "H" node has been made non-standard in order to conserve space in the transmission message.  
 
Data definitions for this file are distributed with the ROES. No data is distributed.
