The ROR REGISTRY RECORD file contains records of local registries. Each record associates a patient with a registry and contains registry-specific and additional service information (when the patient was added to the registry, if they were confirmed, 
etc).  
 
Records of the file are uniquely identified by the patient and the registry (the "A" primary key and the uniqueness index "KEY" are used for that purpose).  
 
When the record of this file is deleted, the logic of the ADELETE cross-reference tries to delete the associated records from the ROR HIV RECORD (#799.4), ROR PATIENT (#798.4), and ROR PATIENT EVENTS (#798.3) files.  
 
A permanent screen (the ^DD(798,0,"SCR") node) restricts access to records of this file. Users can only access records of those registries that they have the security key(s) for. Users with the ROR VA IRM security key can access all records of the file.  
 
If you want the changes in the security keys allocation to have an effect immediately, you should rebuild the "ACL" cross-reference of the .01 field of the SECURITY KEY multiple of the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1). See the description of the
cross-reference for more details.

              DESCRIPTION:      The PATIENT NAME field identifies a patient in the registry. You can select a patient either from the local registry or the ROR PATIENT file, or you can add a new patient from the PATIENT file.  
                                 
                                You can only select records of those registries that you have appropriate security key(s) for.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  An internal value of this field is the patient IEN in the PATIENT file (#2) because records in the ROR PATIENT file (#798.4) have the same internal entry numbers as corresponding records in the PATIENT file.  Patient
                                records in all registries can be found by traditional "B" cross-reference.  
                                 
                                When value of this field is deleted (which means deletion of the whole record), the logic of the ADELETE cross-reference tries to delete associated records from the ROR HIV STUDY (#799.4), ROR PATIENT (#798.4), and ROR
                                PATIENT EVENTS (#798.3) files.
