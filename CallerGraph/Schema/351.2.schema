This file is used to track inpatient episodes for Category C veterans who have claimed exposure to Agent Orange, Ionizing Radiation, and Environmental Contaminants.  
 
These episodes, which are normally billed automatically by the system, require individual review to determine if the care provided was related to the claimed exposure.  If the care was determined to be related to exposure, the patient should not be
billed, but the case disposition must be documented.  
 
A case record will automatically be filed at admission for this special group of patients, and updated when the patient is discharged.  The site then has 45 days to disposition the case, i.e. determine if the care was related to the claimed exposure.  If
the care was unrelated, and copayment and per diem charges are created in the Cancel/Edit/Add Patient Charges option, the case record will be automatically dispositioned.  If the patient is not going to be billed, the reason for not billing must be
entered into this file.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
