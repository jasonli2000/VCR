              DESCRIPTION:
                                Time frame is the period of time over which the program begins capturing data and then sums up the data to start all over again with the beginning of the next similar time frame.

              DESCRIPTION:      For PERCENT thresholds: This field defines the minimum sample size (denominator) that must be reached before threshold checking occurs.  For NUMERIC thresholds: This field may be used along with the BULLETIN WHEN MIN
                                SAMPLE MET field (set to YES) as a pre-threshold notification.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a number, optionally followed by a per-cent (%) sign, 8 characters max. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Threshold defines the number or percentage of fall outs after which some specific action will occur.  The threshold may be entered as a pure numeric response (e.g., 38), or as a percentage (e.g., 38%).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'Hi' or 'Lo' to determine when threshold should be met. 
              DESCRIPTION:      If the user chooses 'Hi', the threshold will be met when the percentage is calculated to be >= the threshold.  If the user chooses 'Lo', the threshold will be met when the percentage is calculated to be <= the threshold.  
                                Hi/Lo Percent is only meaningful for percent thresholds.

                                to stop using a monitor, this switch should be turned off.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter Y(es) if duplicate fall outs are allowed within a time frame. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Answering Y(es) to this question allows an event to fall out multiple times for the same patient within a given time frame.  Answering N(o) will allow the event to fall out only once per time frame.  
                                 
                                For example, a monitor is set up to capture all admissions over a monthly time frame.  Assume a patient is admitted twice in the same month.  Answering 'NO' to this question will capture only the patient's first admission. 
                                Answering 'YES' will capture both.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field controls which of the conditions will provide the date that will be used as the event date for the fall out.  You will usually want to pick the condition whose date most uniquely defines the event you are
                                monitoring.  For example, if you were monitoring all female (Condition #1: SEX) admissions (Condition #2: MAS MOVEMENT TYPE) you would pick condition number two as the condition to supply the event date.
