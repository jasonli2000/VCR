This file contains the definition of each of the laboratory controls used as part of the laboratory's quality control program.  Every lab control for which data will be gathered, entered, calculated, recorded and/or stored by the system must have an
entry in this file.  Also to be included as entries in this file are any 'control-like' samples which might appear on any of your load or work lists (see file #68.2 - LOAD/WORK LIST), including references, blanks, water samples or similar priming
materials.  Each lab control name entry is defined by the file, listing information such as expiration date, lot number, type of specimen the control 'mimics', tests performed on the control, mean and standard deviation values, etc.
