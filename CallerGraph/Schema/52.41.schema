              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the internal number of the order from the ORDER file (#100), representing the corresponding Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) order to this pending Outpatient Pharmacy order. This field also 
                                acts as a temporary holding place for any external system order number, for orders received from any external system. An external system order number will only be stored here temporarily, until the CPRS order number is
                                received to replace the external system order number.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field holds either the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) order number, or an external system order number. If this field is populated with an external system order number, it will only be populated with that
                                number temporarily, because as soon as that order is received, the order is then sent to CPRS, and CPRS will return to Pharmacy a CPRS order number, and that number will then replace the external system order number.

                                know all EI's that apply, and to know how they relate to the ICD-9 code without affecting Copay functionality.
