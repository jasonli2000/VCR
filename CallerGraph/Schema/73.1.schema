The Rad Modality Defined Terms file is required by the VistA Imaging application; entries in this file are as defined in the DICOM Standards PS 3.3 - 1998 under section General Series Attribute Descriptions (C.7.3.1.1).  The Radiology developers update
entries in the file in accordance to changes in the DICOM Standards.  THIS FILE CAN NOT BE EDITED.  
 
This file is pointed to by the RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURE (#71), and for each active procedure a modality or modalities must be identified.  It is possible for a single procedure to be performed on multiple modalities.  For example, a GASTROGRAPHIN UGI
procedure can be done on a Radio Fluoroscopy and a Computed Radiography modality.  
 
VistA Imaging software will build a modality worklist using this file and the RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURE file entries.  The worklist identifies the scheduled radiology cases to be performed on the individual modality (equipment).
