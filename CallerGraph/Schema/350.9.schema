                                not done in the background.

                                will have been completed manually so that charges created by the conversion may easily be passed to the Accounts Receivable package (and thus billed to the patient).

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the task number of a job that is scheduled to run which performs all clean-up tasks when an Insurance Company is deleted.  After the tasked job runs to completion, the value of this field will be
                                deleted.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is used to control background processing when an Insurance Company is deleted.  When a company is 'deleted' using the Delete Company action within the Insurance Company editor, a background task needs to be
                                queued to perform final clean-up tasks.  This job searches several files and is queued to run during non-business hours.  However, if subsequent companies are also deleted before the queued job runs, it would not be
                                desirable to queue another job.  
                                 
                                The task number for the background job for the first deleted company is stored in this field.  The value is then used when subsequent companies are deleted, to determine if another job should be queued or not.  When a
                                company is deleted, if this field contains a task number, and that task number is queued to run, then a second task will not be queued.  The queued job will delete the value from this field at job completion.

                                This is the main parameter that contro what past care can be entered into claims tracking.  At no time does the software automatically add entires older than this date.  The one exception is that this parameter does not

              LAST EDITED:      AUG 04, 1993 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field determines what inpatients will automatically be added to the claims tracking module.  If this parameter is set to "OFF" then no new patients will be added.  If this is set to "INSURED AND UR ONLY" then only the
                                insured patients and random sample patients will be added.  If this is set to "ALL PATIENTS" then a record of all admissions will be created.  
                                 
                                If a patient is not insured then each record will be so annotated automatically on creation and no follow-up will be required.  The advantage of tracking all patients is that you can determine the percentage of billable
                                cases and make necessary adjustments if the patients are later found to have insurance.  The disadvantage is that additional capacity is used.

                                outpatient visits for insured patients will be added.  If this parameter is set to ALL PATIENTS then the outpatient visits for all patients will be added to claims tracking.

              LAST EDITED:      AUG 04, 1993 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field determines if prescriptions will automatically be entered into the claims tracking module.  If this is answered "OFF" then no prescriptions or refills will be entered.  If this is answered "INSURED ONLY", then
                                only prescriptions and refills will be added if the patient is insured.  If all is choose then an entry for all prescriptions will be entered.  
                                 
                                If a prescription or refill does not appear to be billable, that is it may be for SC care, or there is a visit date associated with that prescription or refill, this will be so noted in the reason not billable.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field will be used to determine if prosthetics should be tracked in the claims tracking module.  If this parameter is set to OFF, then no prosthetic entries will be added to claims tracking.  If this is set to INSURED
                                ONLY then only parameter entries for insured patients will be added to claims tracking.  If this is set to ALL PATIENTS then an entry will be created for all patients prosthetic items.

              DESCRIPTION:      Enter 'Yes' if you would like a detailed patient listing of unbilled cases automatically printed each month, when the option Auto-Generate Unbilled Amounts Report runs on the first of each month.  If you answer 'Yes' you

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the status that a PTF record must be in before the automated biller will attempt to create an inpatient bill.  
                                 
                                The auto biller will use the Frequency, Billing Cycle and Days Delay parameters to decide when to try to create an inpatient bill.  However, the auto biller can not set up a bill until the PTF record is Closed.  Of the two
                                dates, the date calculated from the site parameters or the date that the PTF record meets the Status entered here, the bill will be created on the later date.

                                Some sites want to wait until the PTF is closed before a bill is created because they know it will be coded at that time.  Others do not want to bill until the PTF record has been transmitted and they know that it is 
                                complete.  
                                 
                                After this had been added it was decided that an auto bill should not be created for inpatients until after the PTF record has been closed.  So, the option of creating an auto bill when the PTF record was still open was
                                removed.

                                  For the Appointments extract (#2), this indicates how far in the future a patient can be scheduled for an appointment and be eligible for extract.  If the value is 10, then a patient will be eligible for extract if their
                                  appointment is within 10 days of the extract date.  
                                   
                                  For the Non-Verified Insurance extract (#3), this indicates how far in the past a patient must have been seen to be eligible for extract.  If the value is 10, then a patient will be eligible for extract if they were seen
                                  in the last 10 days.

                                  For the Non-Verified Insurance extract, this is similar to the FRESHNESS DAYS parameter in that this represents how long to wait before eIV can attempt to re-verify the same insurance for that patient. 
                                   
                                  If the value is 10, this means that eIV can attempt to re-verify insurance for a patient 11 days after the most recently inquired date.  A specific date is always asked of the payer when trying to determine patient's
                                  eligibility.

                                  not resolve to a valid and eligible payer, this flag will not allow an Insurance Buffer entry to be created and flagged to be corrected manually before being sent out.  This is intended to reduce the number of Insurance
