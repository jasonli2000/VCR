This file is a work file of patients who were inpatients as of 11:59pm on acensus date.  File entries are created by the Regenerate Census Workfile option of the Census module.  
 
The file is used to produce the Census Status Report.  Without this workfile, it would be necessary to search all admissions in order to compile this report.  This file eliminates that processing.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field contains the internal entry number to the patient's admission multiple.  This number represent the admission entry that caused this workfile entry to be created.

              LAST EDITED:      APR 12, 1990 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the CENSUS DATE that the workfile entry is associated.  
                                 
                                Note that an admission can be associated with more than one census record but each workfile entry is associated with only one census record.  
                                 
                                As an example, a patient who was a continuous inpatient from 8/1/91 to 11/1/92 would have census records for the 9/30/91 and 9/30/92 censuses. This admission would have two workfile entries.
