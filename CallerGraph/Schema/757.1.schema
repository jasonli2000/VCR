This file maps semantic classes and semantic types to the major concept, providing contextual meaning to both the term as well as the words contained in the term.  This semantic meaning, when applied to the terms, is used as a filter during term file
look-ups.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is a pointer to the Major Concept, linking the semantic classification with a concept.  Only Major Concepts are semantically classified.   Synonyms and Lexical Variants adopt the semantic classification of the parent
                                Major Concept.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is a pointer to the general semantic class defined in the Semantic Class file #757.11 to which the Major Concept belongs.  An example of a semantic class is ORG for concepts in the general class of Organisms.

                                Major Concept belongs and IEN is the Internal Entry Nunber in the Semantic Map file #757.1 where the Major Concept/Semantic Class combination is located.  This index is used extensively for filtered searches based on

              DESCRIPTION:      This is a pointer to the specific semantic type defined in the Semantic Types file #757.12 to which the Major Concept belongs.  Using the general semantic class ORG (Organism), examples of specific semantic types would be
