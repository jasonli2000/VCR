This file is used to store the user, process and date@time a Generic Code Sheet process was locked.  A process can be defined as batching or transmitting code sheets.  
 
The data stored in this file is for informational purposes only.  It is not used to control the locking of processes in Generic Code Sheets.  
 
Generic Code Sheets uses incremental locks to prevent users from batching and transmitting duplicate code sheets.  When one user is batching or transmitting and a second user tries to run the same process, a message is displayed from this file to the
second user.
