                                K000001-01).

                  Short Descr:  Update the line level providers for claim FORM TYPE change.

                                The patch introduces line providers to the Bill/Claims process. Line providers (Sub-file 399.0404) are based on the claim FORM TYPE. So, when there is a change in claim FORM TYPE, then we want to update the line level
                                providers to be in agreement with the claim FORM TYPE (see below for FORM TYPE and allowable line provider types). In the case when the FORM TYPE field is changed, then the line provider types are checked to see if any, or
                                all, line providers need to be deleted from the claim.

                                    in the IBLNPRV array to be deleted.  
                                    Note: IBLNPRV array holds the procedure IENs (Sub-file 399.0304), and 
                                    line provider IENs and .01 field (Sub-file 399.0404,.01) equal to the

                                This defines the length of stay in days for this inpatient episode excluding pass, AA, and UA days.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  If no PTF defined then uses the Statement From and To dates for LOS.  Excludes pass, AA, UA days but includes days in non-billable bedsections.  Notice that the number of units of service under revenue code only includes
                                billable bedsections so the number of units may not add up to the length of stay if the patient was in a non-billable bedsection for awhile.  LOS of a stay where admit day=discharge day is 1.  LOS of a stay where admit
                                date+1=discharge date also has an LOS of 1.  The discharge date is not charged.  Therefore, on continuous first and interum bills the LOS is the date range inclusive of the last day on the bill, all other bills exclude the
                                last day (with exception of admit=discharge day).

      Description:  Whenever the fields in this x-ref are changed in any way (add/edit/delete) the billing provider and service facility for the claim may change so we need to recalculate the default values of the billing provider taxonomy code, the
                    service facility taxonomy code, and the billing provider secondary IDs and Qualifiers for every payer on the claim.  
                     
                    Please note that this x-ref will potentially update the values of 8 fields in file 399:
