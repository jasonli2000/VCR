779.1,.01     DOMAIN NAME            0;1 FREE TEXT (Required)

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>64!($L(X)<3)!'(X'?1P.E) X
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 05, 2004 
              HELP-PROMPT:      The domain name for this system.  It will be used to populate component 2 of the Sending Facility field of the HL7 message header. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                The domain name for this system.  It will be used to populate component 2 of the Sending Facility field of the HL7 message headers.

779.1,.02     STATION NUMBER         0;2 FREE TEXT

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>7!($L(X)<3) X
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 05, 2004 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the station number with suffix that this system belongs under.  It will be used in component 1 of the Sending Facility field of the HL7 message header. 

779.1,.03     PRODUCTION ID          0;3 SET (Required)

                                'P' FOR production; 
                                'T' FOR training; 
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 05, 2004 
              HELP-PROMPT:      ENTER P if this is a production system, T otherwise. 

779.1,.04     MAXIMUM STRING LENGTH  0;4 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>99999)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      JUL 06, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This is the maximum length for strings built by HLO when local applications create new messages to send. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter determines the maximum length for strings that HLO will create when messages are being built.  It doesn't apply to servers, as the size of input buffer used by TCP/IP determines the maximum string length
                                created by a single read.  


779.1,.05     BUFFER SIZE FOR HL7 (BYTES) 0;5 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>20000)!(X<10000)!(X?.E1"."1.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 05, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This parameter represents the size of the buffer used by HLO for its background processes.  It defaults to 15000 bytes, but may be set from 10,000 bytes to 20,000 bytes. 

779.1,.06     BUFFER SIZE FOR USER (BYTES) 0;6 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>10000)!(X<512)!(X?.E1"."1.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 05, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This parameter is the size of the buffer used by HLO in the context of an online user.  It defaults to 5000, but may be reset to between 512 and 10000 bytes. 

779.1,.07     NORMAL MSG RETENTION (HOURS) 0;7 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>96)!(X<36)!(X?.E1"."1.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      MAR 17, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      How many hours should successfully completed messages remain on your system? (36-96 hours, defaults to 36 hours)  
              DESCRIPTION:      This field controls the purging of HL7 messages whose completion status is SUCCESSFUL. It is in hours, since messages normally should be purged very soon after completion, with an allowed range of 36 to 94 hours.  
                                 
                                36 is the default because this 1) will result in most messages being purged at night and 2) provides sufficient time for the Capacity Planning statistics to be extracted. 


779.1,.08     BAD MESSAGE RETENTION (DAYS) 0;8 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>45)!(X<5)!(X?.E1"."1.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      NOV 15, 2004 
              HELP-PROMPT:      How many days should message with errors remain on your system?  (7-45 days, defaults to 7 days) 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field controls the purging of HL7 messages that do not complete successfully.  The period should be reasonably long to allow investigation, but because of the extremely high daily volume of messages purging must occur
                                quickly.  


779.1,.09     HLO ON/OFF SWITCH      0;9 SET

                                '0' FOR OFF; 
                                '1' FOR ON; 
              LAST EDITED:      MAY 03, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Set to 0 to turn off messaging and all HL7 processes. 

779.1,.1      HLO STANDARD LISTENER  0;10 POINTER TO HL LOGICAL LINK FILE (#870)

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  S DIC("S")="I ($P($G(^HLCS(870,Y,400)),""^"",3)=""M"")!($P($G(^HLCS(870,Y,400)),""^"",3)=""S"")" D ^DIC K DIC S DIC=$G(DIE),X=+Y K:Y<0 X
              LAST EDITED:      JUN 01, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Select an entry from the HL Logical Link file that is the listener that remote applications will normally connect to. 
              SCREEN:           S DIC("S")="I ($P($G(^HLCS(870,Y,400)),""^"",3)=""M"")!($P($G(^HLCS(870,Y,400)),""^"",3)=""S"")"
              EXPLANATION:      This screen allows only server entries to be selected.

779.1,.11     HLO RECOUNT ON/OFF FLAG 0;11 SET

                                '0' FOR OFF; 
                                '1' FOR ON; 
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 25, 2007 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Set to 1 to disallow update of queues when a recount is being performed.
