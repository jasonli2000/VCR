                    DESCRIPTION:      This should be the next smallest area of the laboratory service after the LAB DIVISION  This field is used to further break down the workload.  Generally this will be the ACCESSION area into which the order was

                                      entered the test accession area will be used.

                                      attached to a LOAD/WORK LIST.  It is controlled by selecting a worklist during verification.
