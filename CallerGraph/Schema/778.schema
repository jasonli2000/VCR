              DESCRIPTION:      Applications may have difficulty insuring that messages are received by the remote application in the same order that the sending application generates the messages.  If an application determines that maintaining the order
                                of its messages is necessary, one method it may use it to specify that 1) Application acknowledgemnts are needed  and 2) that the messages should be placed on a sequence queue.   Messages that are placed on a particular
                                sequence queue are not moved to the outgoing queue for transmission until the application acknolwedgment for the preceding message is received.  This guarantees the order of delivery.
