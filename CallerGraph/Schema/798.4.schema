The ROR PATIENT file contains patient information that is common for all local registries (mostly, demographic information).  
 
Most of the fields in the file have the same numbers and names as the corresponding fields in the PATIENT file.  
 
Demographic data from this file is compared to that from the PATIENT file (#2) to determine if it has been changed since the last registry data extraction. These fields are updated with the values from the PATIENT file and the UPDATE DEMOGRAPHICS flag is
set to "YES" in all active registry records of the patient.  
 
Records in the file have the same internal entry numbers as the patients' records in the PATIENT file. The records are uniquely identified by the internal value of the PATIENT NAME field.  
 
A permanent screen (the ^DD(798.4,0,"SCR") node) restricts access to the records of this file. Only users with the security key(s) for any defined registry (or those with the ROR VA IRM security key) can access records of the file.  
 
If you want the changes in the security keys allocation to have an effect immediately, you should rebuild the "ACL" cross-reference of the .01 field of the SECURITY KEY multiple of the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1). See the description of the
cross-reference for more details.
