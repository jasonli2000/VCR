                                  Then, the requested maximum number of images is 
                                  calculated according to the total number of

                                  field.  
                                     
                                  If the number of entries in the "priority" 
                                  buffer is less than the calculated maximum 
                                  number of images and the regular buffer is not 
                                  empty, then missing quantity of preselected 
                                  images is merged to the "priority" buffer from 
                                  the regular one.  
                                 
                                  Finally, no more than the maximum number of 
                                  entries is returned from the "priority" buffer 
                                  as the result of the search.
