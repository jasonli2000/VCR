This file contains expanded taxonomies. It is used as a data cache so the expansion does not need to be continuously done. The expansion is rebuilt whenever a taxonomy is edited or one of the source files has changed since the expansion was last done.
The source files are ICD0, ICD9, and ICPT.  
 
Entries in this file should never be set by hand.
