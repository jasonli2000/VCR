              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 1 to make the skin test type inactive. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to inactivate a skin test type.  If this field contains a "1" then the skin test is inactive.  Inactive skin tests cannot be selected in the manual data entry process.  Skin test entries should be made
                                inactive when they are no longer used.  Do not delete the entry or change the meaning of the skin test entry.  
                                  
                                To make an inactive skin test active, enter the "@" symbol to delete the "1" from the field.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field was added for use by PCE in the VA.  
                                 
                                This inactive flag should be used, rather than deleting entries in the skin test file, since there may be other files pointing at the skin test entry.
