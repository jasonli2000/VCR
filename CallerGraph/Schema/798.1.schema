Records of the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file contain various registry parameters and the data that indicates current registry state. Every registry must have a record in this file.  
 
Records of the file are uniquely identified by the registry name (the "A" primary key and the uniqueness index "B" are used for that purpose).  
 
A permanent screen (the ^DD(798.1,0,"SCR") node) restricts access to records of this file. Users can only access records of those registries that they have the security key(s) for. Users with the ROR VA IRM security key can access all records of the
file.  
 
If you want the changes in the security keys allocation to have an effect immediately, you should rebuild the "ACL" cross-reference of the .01 field of the SECURITY KEY multiple of this file. See the description of the cross-reference for more details.

                                  If one of the registries requests recording of all events, all events except the debug messages (type 1) will be recorded for all registries.  
                                   
                                  Otherwise, merged content of the LOG EVENT multiples will determine the events to be recorded.

                                messages, etc.).

                                Otherwise, the nightly task increments the error counters and checks the remainders from division of the counters by the value of this field. When a reminder becomes 0, the software sends the corresponding e-mail
                                notification to the AAC and generates the VistA alert to the local staff listed in the NOTIFICATION multiple (14).  
                                 
                                For example, if the nightly task runs every night and the ALERT FREQUENCY is 2, then alerts and notifications will be sent every other night.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter number of days between 1 and 7. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Number of days that defines an overlap of the data searches during the registry updates and a data extraction delay during the regular data extractions.  
                                 
                                If this field is empty, the default value of 1 is used by the registry update and data extraction processes.  
                                 
                                See the package documentation or Technical Description of the field in the data dictionary for more information.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Clinical data may be entered into the VistA system later than they are available. For example, an encounter that occurred today may not get entered into the system until tomorrow.  
                                 
                                Because of this delay, data may be missed by the registry update and data extraction processes if they look for the data until the current date and then continue from that point next time.  
                                 
                                To avoid this problem, data search intervals are overlapped by the number of days indicated by this field. The registry update process looks for new data not from the end date of its previous run but from the date that is
                                earlier by the number of days from this field. This overlap increases the chances of data entered retrospectively to be found by the next run of the registry update process.  
                                 
                                Moreover, the regular data extraction process extracts data not until the date when the process is run but until the date that is earlier by the number of days from this field. So, this is a delay that allows the data to
                                be entered retrospectively before the next data extraction.  
                                 
                                If the value of this field is too small, you may miss some data entered retrospectively. If it is too big, the national registry will not contain up to date information (data will be delayed by the number of days indicated
                                by this field) and the registry update process will take more time to complete, because additional time will be spent processing the data from the overlap interval).  
                                 
                                When several registries are processed at the same time, the maximum value of the LAG DAYS field is used.

                                  This cross-reference is used by the screening logic (the "SCR" node) of some Clinical Case Registries files to check whether a user is allowed to access the records or not.  
                                   
                                  The cross-reference contains two kinds of items:

                                  where RORDUZ is the value of the DUZ variable for the user who has access to one or more registries (according to the allocated security keys). RegIEN and RegName are the registry IEN and name. KEY is the name of
                                  security key and IEN is the internal entry number of the corresponding record of the SECURITY KEY multiple.  
                                   
                                  The cross-reference should be rebuilt after changes in the allocation of the security keys associated with any registry. Usually, this is done by the nightly task (the [ROR TASK] option).  However, if you want the
                                  changes to be in effect immediately, you should rebuild this cross-reference manually.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the internal batch identifier that was used during the generation of the batch message.  
                                   
                                  The Control ID of each individual message included in the batch is constructed from the value of this field and a sequential number separated by the '-' character.  

                TECHNICAL DESCR:  The INTERNAL BATCH ID field is automatically populated with the identifier of the batch placeholder created by the CREATE^HLTF procedure. See the $$CREATE^RORHL7 and $$TMSTMP^ROREXTUT functions for details.  
                                   
                                  The actual batch control ID (BHS-11) is usually different from the value stored in this field.

                                If at least one of the defined registries enables the protocols, they will process the events and create references in the ROR PATIENT EVENTS file (#798.3).
