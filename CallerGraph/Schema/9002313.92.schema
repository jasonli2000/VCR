              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter if the total is exclusive of the patient amount 
              DESCRIPTION:      This refers to the interpretation of the fields in the response packets, as copied to 9002313.03, Response(s) multiple, fields 509 Total Amount Paid and 505 Patient Paid Amount.  For most formats and insurers 509 Total 
                                Amount Paid means Total, Patient plus Insurer.  Other insurers don't do it that way - for them, 509 contains only the amount paid by insurance.  $$NETPAID1 needs to know whether to do the subtraction.  If $$NETPAID1 
                                encounters a case where (#509)<(#505), it will set the flag in the format, locally.
