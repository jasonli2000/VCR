              DESCRIPTION:      This is the text captured with the error.  It is a means of providing a common key for the errors to be clustered under.  Each one will has a series of characteristics which will be captured for later analysis even after
                                the error has been purged off of the ^%ZTER global.  The first date and time is stored as will be the most recent occurrence.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                This string will be parsed off of the $ZE sting.  If the string is not there, then an "[Unknown Xecute]" will be created to store these cases.

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 05, 2008 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the first date and time that the error has occurred.  It is of historic importance and can be used to find the causative event of the error that is being reported.

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 24, 2009 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the most recent time that the situation has happened.  It is important in that it is the most likely to still be in the error trap global, ^%ZTER.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  As this gets updated, the date is compared with the date/time stored here.  This will help to identify any items which may need to be accessioned into this summary.  It may also be used to help purge any errors which have
                                not been active in a long time (and perhaps is now obsolete code).

                                string presentation if the causative program is found to be different.

                                personnel in the specific area of concern with this package.  The groups should be self-enrolling and be able to receive the generated email that will be batched for the errors of the day.
