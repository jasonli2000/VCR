              DESCRIPTION:      Enter the Base Charge associated with the item.  This amount will be added once for the item on the bill, instead of once for each unit of the item.  Base Charge is appropriate for only specific types of charges where the
                                total charge for the item is an incremental Unit charge plus a single Base charge, such as Minutes and Hours.
