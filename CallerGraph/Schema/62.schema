                                The SNOMED CT concept identifiers assigned by The International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation has the following specifications.  
                                 
                                The SCTID data type is a 64-bit integer, which is subject to the following constraints: 
                                 Only positive integer values are permitted.  
                                 The minimum permitted value is 100,000 (6 digits) 
                                 The maximum permitted value is 999,999,999,999,999,999 (18-digits).  
                                 As a result of rules for the partition-identifier and check-digit, many 
                                 integers within this range are not valid SCTIDs.  
                                 
                                Storage of these identifiers in this file is of data type free text with a 6-18 character length and a numeric pattern match. This conforms to The Department of Veterans Affairs M Programming Standards and Conventions
                                2008. The VA SACC has reviewed and indicated this data storage is within standards and conventions.  
                                 
                                -----------------------------
                                The SNOMED CT ID (SCTID) field needs to be a valid SNOMED CT concept.  
                                 
                                The INPUT TRANSFORM checks if the SCT code is valid.  If not the INPUT TRANSFORM fails.  
                                 
                                ------------------------------
                                 
                                This field is modified only by non-interactive means via updates from the VA Standard Terminology Services.  
                                 
                                The variable LRFMERTS is used by the AERT xref to determine if the field is being edited by a user or by a process.
