              DESCRIPTION:      This is the name of the Patient Education Topic. Patient Education Topics are the subject on which a patient needs some more information in order to continue on his road to better health. For example, a patient may have 
                                had some podiatry work done and received foot care education. 'foot care' would be the name of the education topic.

              LAST EDITED:      AUG 25, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 1 to make the education topic inactive or an '@' to make it active. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to inactivate an education topic.  If this field contains a "1" then the education topic is inactive.  Inactive education topics cannot be selected in the manual data entry process.  Education topic
                                entries should be made inactive when they are no longer used.  Do not delete the entry or change the meaning of the education topic entry.  
                                 
                                To make an inactive education topic active, enter the symbol "@" to delete the "1" from the field.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field was added for use by PCE in the VA.  
                                 
                                The Inactive flag should be used to manage manual access to education topics, rather than physically deleting obsolete or inactive entries from the Education Topic file.  This allows files to still point to the obsolete or
                                inactive education topic for historical purposes.
