                                would be input for a Pre-Admit (A05) message.  It contains data for field #2.08 (Expected Admit Date/Time), but normally does not contain data for field #1.44 (Admit Date/Time).  In these cases, the data for field #2.08 is
                                also placed in field #1.44, so that field #1.44 will be non-null, and both "AC" and "AF" cross-references can be set.
