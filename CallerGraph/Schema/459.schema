              DESCRIPTION:

                                  This cross reference contains the 4 digit year associated with the .01 field's 2 digit year & pay period #.  The cross reference allows chronological sorting accross centuries.  This is in contrast to the "B" x-ref which
                                contains a 2 digit year & does not sort chronologically accross new centuries. 
                                 
                                  The function call IC^PRSAPPU() infers a four digit year from the 2 digit year of the .01 field.  The inference is based upon the parameters passed to the function.  Namely, a future pivot year (parameter #3 - # of years
                                from base date) is used to determine the end of the 100 year range that are valid for selection of the matching 4 digit year.  The number of years in parameter 4 are added to the base date (parameter 4 - default of today) 
                                to determine the end of this range.  Parameter #2 is the format of the year returned (e.g. 4 returns a 4 digit year).
