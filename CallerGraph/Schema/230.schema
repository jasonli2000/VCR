This file serves as the log of emergency department visits.  It works together with the ED LOG HISTORY file to track when activities of a typical emergency department visit are done.  It records where the patient went, who was responsible, and when key
things happened (such as triage and disposition).  
 
This file serves as the key source of information for data that is displayed on the emergency department display board (an electronic "white board").  Patient visits that are currently active are shown on the display board.  The display board is
refreshed every 30 seconds.  Many of the indexes in this file assist in making the refresh code as efficient as possible.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                The area field is also used for training classes.  In the class, each user may be assigned a separate area so as to avoid conflicts when setting up configurations.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the name of the patient.  It allows a name to be entered in the case of humanitarian care when the patient has not been entered into VistA yet.  
                                 
                                LastName,FirstName is the name format that should be used.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field also assists in checking for duplicates and similar names on the display board within a single area.  This allows appropriate indicators to be shown on the display board.  
                                 
                                The clerk only enters the name in this field if the patient is not in VistA.  If the patient gets added to VistA during the visit, the name used in VistA replaces the clerk-entered name.  If the patient is selected from
                                VistA, the software gets the VistA name and places it here.  This allows the software to flag patients with similar names that might be active in the Emergency Department simultaneously.  
                                 
                                This field is set to "(ambulance en route)" in the case where an ambulance is arriving but the name of the patient is unknown.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the patient social security number in the case of humanitarian care for a patient that does not exist in VistA.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the patient in VistA for whom this log record is created.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field may be absent in the case of an arriving ambulance, where the patient is not yet known.  It may also be absent when humanitarian aid is rendered for a non-VA patient.  
                                 
                                If the patient is in VistA, the software gets the name field from file 2 and places it in the PATIENT NAME field in this file. This allows the software to flag patients with similar names who are active in the emergency
                                department at the same time.  The clerk does not enter the PATIENT NAME field directly if the patient is in VistA.

                                last 4 of ssn.  For example, given a fictional patient named TWENTY VEHU with an SSN of 000-00-0020, this field would be V0020.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Since last initial + last 4 digits of the social security number are commonly used to identify patients, this field assists in checking for patients with the same last initial / last 4.  When a VistA patient is selected,
                                the last initial / last 4 is constructed from information in file 2 and stored here.  This allows patients with the same last initial / last 4 to be indicated on the display board.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Since emergency departments don't use appointments, the arrival of the patient is recorded in the emergency department tracking system itself.  The tracking system can then create a visit in PCE so that subsequent care
                                givers can associate orders and progress notes with that same visit.  The visit is created once any PCE related field is collected so that DATA2PCE may be called.  This is usually the triage nurse.
