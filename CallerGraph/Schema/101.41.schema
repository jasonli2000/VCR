              HELP-PROMPT:      Specify a type for this dialog. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field defines the type of order dialog to be processed.  Control will be passed to the OE/RR Dialog Processor for dialog items; menu types are used for displaying and selecting dialog items.  Action types will only 
                                execute the entry and exit actions, ignoring any items that may exist; these dialogs should not create entries in the Orders file.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates what signature will be required for orders created by this dialog, to be considered complete and ready to release to the service for action.  If this flag is set to NO and the dialog contains a prompt 
                                for item(s) from the Orderable Item file, the order created may still require a signature if any of the items ordered are individually flagged as requiring a signature.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is a flag, which determines if the order created by this dialog will be presented to the user for verification before saving in the Orders file; for most quick orders, this flag should be set to 0 (no).

              LAST EDITED:      JUN 16, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES to have the user asked to enter another order from this dialog before exiting. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field allows the user to add another order from this dialog, when the initial order is accepted and placed; if set to YES, the user will be asked "Add another <dialog display text> order?" to allow for either exiting
                                the processor or adding an additional order of the same type.  This field can also be set to YES-DON'T ASK to force the processor to automatically drop into prompting for another order without asking first.

                                   START      -> Start date/time

                                These values must be unique among entries within an order dialog but do not need to be unique across the entire file.  Be sure to check the IDs assigned to generic text entries to make sure that all IDs are unique.  In
                                order to avoid potential problems it's recommended that you use unique IDs for any local entries that you create.

                                processing back down the tree is possible from that point.  If nothing is selected from the menu, the path continues back up the tree.
