                DESCRIPTION:    If visit has an appointment type of computer generated, the UNRESOLVED APPT TYPE REASON field will also be stuffed with the best possible reason why an appropriate appointment type could not be determined.  Currently, if a
                                patient has a comp and pen exam within the last three days of the visit date which is computer generated the unresolved reason will be POSSIBLE COMP & PEN, if a patient has a dual eligibility and one of those eligibilities
                                is Sharing Agreement, Employee, or Collateral, the unresolved reason will be DUAL ELIGIBILITY.  Should there be a scenario where both apply, the default is POSSIBLE COMP & PEN.  This field is updated via the programmer
