The Imaging Site Parameter file contains those variables which are site specific, and which are necessary for the Imaging Software to perform properly. Most of the fields have MUMPs cross-references with which they are associated that are used by the
software for quick access to the specific data. Some of the fields defined may not be in use presently, but are reserved for future development.  Review the Imaging Installation Manual for instructions on making entries into this file.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Current Network Write Location for Image Storage 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is a pointer to the Network Location file defining the current NETWORK WRITE location for captured images. Enter the server that you have designated as the current write server.  There is a separate option to 
                                edit this field when this server either "goes down", or runs out of space.  There is a cross-reference on the field ^MAG(2006.1,"ARITE")=X where X equals the Network Write Location pointer. The software checks this node 
                                before writing the DOS Image file to disk.

                  DESCRIPTION:      A radiologist logged in to this Associated Institution (Division) can lock and interpret exams for the logon division.  When logged in to this Institution, IF you want the radiologist to be able to lock/interpret exams
                                    for other divisions (including the Parent Institution or other Associated Institutions), enter those divisions here.  Note that this setting controls exam locking and updating, as well as filtering of the UNREAD Exams
                                    lists to show only the Institutions that are defined here.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the Network Location to which Images are imported. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Analogous to the Export location, the image IMPORT location is the directory specified to receive incoming images.  This points to the Network Location file, and a MUMPS cross-reference permits quick access to the site
                                specific location.  
                                 
                                The format of this subdirectory must be x:\IMPORT\MAIL\.  It must be located on a file server that supports NFS so that it can be accessed by the main VistA systems.

              HELP-PROMPT:      The three-letter network abbreviation for the site. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a unique identifying string for the site where the Imaging Server is installed.  By convention, the abbreviation should correspond to the 3-character string used for the site in naming the file servers.  E.g., for
                                Washington, D.C., the code is "WAS", corresponding to vhaWASimm1.

              HELP-PROMPT:      DICOM Gateway INTERFACE SWITCH - Set ON/OFF 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is "NULL" if there is no DICOM Gateway interface. If there is a DICOM Gateway, this field serves as a switch to turn the interface ON or OFF. If it is OFF no messages will be transmitted from VistA to the DICOM 
                                Gateway; if ON, then the messages will be transmitted.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                The routines to generate/move HL7 messages to the PACS MESSAGE file will check the existence of this entry before processing.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter Network Location where PACS images are written. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is a pointer to the Network Location file giving the location where PACS images are written by the Commercial PACS SYSTEM, and where VistA first reads them.  (Used mainly if site has a GE PACS using ACRNEMA format.) 

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PACS SYSTEM, to which VistA is interfaced, will write images to a designated network location, as defined by this field which can be changed if necessary. VistA will read from the directory specified by this field. It
                                points to the Network location file - so the full network location must be defined in that file for this to work.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter Network location where converted DICOM IMAGES are written. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field points to the Network Location file and informs the DICOM Image Gateway of the current write drive. DICOM images are first read from the DICOM directory and later converted and copied to the network location 
                                specified by this field.

                                This is the total number of platters in the jukebox installed with your Imaging System. The total number of platters will be a function of the make of the jukebox.

                                automatically changed to point to the next platter, which then becomes the "current" platter.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES to use abstract accesses in determining archive times 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field controls whether user accesses to image abstracts will cause the LAST ACCESS DATE field in the Image file to be updated.  The LAST ACCESS DATE field is used to determine when full and abstract images are removed
                                from magnetic disks and become available only from optical disk.
