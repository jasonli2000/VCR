The Imaging Site Parameter file contains those variables which are site specific, and which are necessary for the Imaging Software to perform properly. Most of the fields have MUMPs cross-references with which they are associated that are used by the
software for quick access to the specific data. Some of the fields defined may not be in use presently, but are reserved for future development.  Review the Imaging Installation Manual for instructions on making entries into this file.  
 
Non-integrated sites and Integrated sites that have one shared image storage location have one record.  Integrated sites where each site has their own image storage have one record for each of the associated sites.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PACS SYSTEM, to which VistA is interfaced, will write images to a designated network location, as defined by this field which can be changed if necessary. VistA will read from the directory specified by this field. It
                                points to the Network location file - so the full network location must be defined in that file for this to work.
