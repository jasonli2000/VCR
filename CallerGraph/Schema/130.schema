                                The AR cross reference on the DATE OF OPERATION field is used to sort and display requested cases.  This cross reference is created when a case is requested or when the request date is changed.  Upon scheduling the

                                The AF MUMPS cross reference on this field is responsible for canceling current IV orders for a patient undergoing a surgical or non-OR procedure if the site parameter is set to allow cancellation of IV orders. 
                                 
                                This cross reference compares the time entered in the ANES CARE START TIME field with the current time. If the difference is more than 24 hours, order cancellation is not allowed. If the difference is more than 1 hour, but
                                not more than 24 hours, the user is warned that a considerable amount of time has passed since the start of the operation or procedure. Finally, if order cancellation is allowed, the user is prompted to cancel current IV
                                orders or not. If the user chooses to cancel IV orders, the Surgery software calls DCOR^PSIVACT.

                                  This MUMPS cross reference provides for updating CPT modifiers for other procedure CPT codes.  CPT modifiers for the OTHER PROCEDURE CPT CODE field (#3) of the OTHER PROCEDURES multiple field (#.42) in SURGERY file

                                  After selecting a CPT code, this cross reference prompts the user for a CPT modifier.  If a CPT modifier was entered concatenated with a hyphen to the CPT code, this CPT modifier is displayed as a default modifier. Upon 
                                  entering a CPT modifier, the user is prompted for another CPT modifier until the user makes a null entry. CPT modifier input is controlled by the input transform on the OTHER PROCEDURE CPT MODIFIER field (#.01 of 
                                  sub-file #130.164).  At the CPT modifier prompt, the user may enter a question mark (?) to see a list of CPT modifiers already entered and a list of acceptable CPT modifiers to choose from.  If the user selects a 
                                  modifier already entered, the user may change or delete the modifier.  If a user enters a new CPT code, replacing a previously entered CPT code, KILL logic on the ACPT1 cross reference deletes any previously entered CPT 
                                  modifiers for the old CPT code before the SET logic prompts the user to enter CPT modifiers for the new CPT code.

                                This MUMPS cross reference provides for updating CPT modifiers for the principal procedure code.  CPT modifiers for the PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE CODE field (#27) are stored in the PRIN. PROCEDURE CPT MODIFIER field (#.01) of

                                entering a CPT modifier, the user is prompted for another CPT modifier until the user makes a null entry. CPT modifier input is controlled by the input transform on the PRIN. PROCEDURE CPT MODIFIER field (#28). At the CPT

                                change or delete the modifier.  If a user enters a new CPT code, replacing a previously entered CPT code, KILL logic on the ACPT cross reference deletes any previously entered CPT modifiers for the old CPT code before the
                                SET logic prompts the user to enter CPT modifiers for the new CPT code.

                                is 0 to 200. If the chart documents differing values for pack year cigarette history, or ranges for either packs/day or number of years patient has smoked, select the highest value documented, unless you are confident in a
                                particular documenter's assessment (e.g., preoperative anesthesia evaluation often includes a more accurate assessment of this value because of the impact it may have on the patient's response to anesthesia).

                                    independently with a limb prosthesis.  Partially dependent - The patient is partially dependent. He/she 
                                    requires the use of equipment or devices coupled with assistance 
                                    from another person for some activities of daily living. Any

                                    maintains independent functions, is considered partially dependent.  Totally dependent - The patient is totally dependent and cannot perform 
                                    ANY activities of daily living on his/her own. This includes a 
                                    patient in an ICU/floor, or who is totally dependent on nursing 
                                    care, or a dependent nursing home patient.  
                                 
                                All patients with psychiatric illnesses should be evaluated for their ability to function with or without assistance with ADLs in the same manner as the non-psychiatric patient. For instance, if a patient with 
                                schizophrenia is able to care for himself without the assistance of nursing care, he/she is considered independent.

              DESCRIPTION:      NSQIP Definition (2007): Sepsis is a vast clinical entity that takes a variety of forms. The spectrum of disorders spans from relatively mild physiologic abnormalities to septic shock. Please report the most significant
                                level using the criteria below: 
                                 
                                1. Sepsis: Sepsis is the systemic response to infection. Report this variable if the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS. SIRS is a widespread inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinical insults. This
                                syndrome is clinically recognized by the presence of two or more of the following: 
                                   - Temp >38 degrees C or <36 degrees C 
                                   - HR >90 bpm 
                                   - RR >20 breaths/min or PaCO2 <32 mmHg(<4.3 kPa) 
                                   - WBC >12,000 cell/mm3, <4000 cells/mm3, or >10% immature (band)

                                   - Anion gap acidosis: this is defined by either: 
                                      [Na + K] - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is 
                                      greater than 16, then an anion gap acidosis is present.  
                                     or 
                                      Na - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is greater 
                                      than 12, then an anion gap acidosis is present.  
                                 
                                 and one of the following: 
                                   - positive blood culture 
                                   - clinical documentation of purulence or positive culture from any 
                                     site thought to be causative 
                                 
                                2. Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock: Sepsis is considered severe when it is associated with organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Report this variable if the patient has the clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS or sepsis AND
                                documented organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Examples of organ dysfunction include: oliguria, acute alteration in mental status, acute respiratory distress. Examples of circulatory dysfunction include: hypotension,
                                requirement of inotropic or vasopressor agents.  
                                 
                                * For the patient that had sepsis preoperatively, worsening of any of the above signs postoperatively would be reported as a postoperative sepsis.  
                                 
                                Examples: 
                                 
                                A patient comes into the emergency room with signs of sepsis - WBC 31, Temperature 104. CT shows an abdominal abscess. He is given antibiotics and is then taken emergently to the OR to drain the abscess. He receives
                                antibiotics intraoperatively. Postoperatively his WBC and Temperature are trending down.  
                                  POD#1 WBC 24, Temp 102 
                                  POD#2 WBC 14, Temp 100 
                                  POD#3 WBC 10, Temp 99 This patient does not have postoperative sepsis as his WBC and Temperature are improving each postoperative day. 
                                 
                                Patient comes into the ER with s/s of sepsis - WBC 31, Temp 104. CT shows an abdominal abscess. He is given antibiotics and is taken emergently to the OR to drain the abscess. He receives antibiotics intraoperatively.
                                Postoperatively his WBC and Temp are as follows:  
                                  POD#1 WBC 28, Temp 103 
                                  POD#2 WBC 24, Temp 102.6 
                                  POD#3 WBC 22, Temp 102 
                                  POD#4 WBC 21, Temp 101.6 
                                  POD#5 WBC 30, Temp 104  This patient does have postoperative sepsis because on postoperative day #5, his WBC and Temperature increase. The patient is having worsening of the defined signs of sepsis.

                                   I - Ordinary physical activity, such as walking or climbing stairs does 
                                       not cause angina.  Angina may occur with strenuous or rapid or 
                                       prolonged exertion at work or recreation.  
                                  II - There is slight limitation of ordinary activity.  Angina may occur 
                                       with walking or climbing stairs rapidly, walking uphill, walking or 
                                       stair climbing after meals or in the cold, in the wind, or under

              DESCRIPTION:      NSQIP Definition (2007): The patient describes difficult, painful, or labored breathing.  Dyspnea may be symptomatic of numerous disorders that interfere with adequate ventilation or perfusion of the blood with oxygen. The 
                                dyspneic patient is subjectively aware of difficulty with breathing.  Select one of the following categories that best indicates the patient's subjective experience coupled with your objective assessment: 
                                 
                                 (1) No dyspnea 
                                 (2) Dyspnea upon moderate exertion (e.g., is unable to climb one 
                                     flight of stairs without shortness of breath) 
                                 (3) Dyspnea at rest (e.g., cannot complete a sentence without needing 
                                     to take a breath) 
                                 
                                The time frame is at the time the patient is being considered as a candidate for surgery (which should be no longer than 30 days prior to surgery). If the patient's dyspnea status worsens prior to surgery, report the most

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES if this patient has impaired sensorium. 
              DESCRIPTION:      NSQIP Definition (2004): Patient is acutely confused and/or delirious and responds to verbal and/or mild tactile stimulation. Patients should be noted to have developed an impaired sensorium if they have mental status
                                changes, and/or delirium in the context of the current illness. Patients with chronic or long-standing mental status changes secondary to chronic mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia) or chronic dementing illnesses (e.g.,
                                multi-infarct dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type) should not be included. This assessment of the patient's mental status should be within 48 hours prior to the surgical procedure. If the patient develops
                                impaired sensorium, then progresses to a coma, and remains in a coma entering surgery, report just coma.  
                                 
                                 Example: A patient is admitted to the orthopedics service after a fall 
                                 with a fractured hip. The patient is also noted to be dehydrated and 
                                 febrile. He is disoriented to place and time and seems confused. His 
                                 family reports that he has been oriented and alert prior to the fall.  
                                 This patient has an impaired sensorium on the basis of his confusion 
                                 and disorientation.  
                                 
                                 Example: A patient is admitted to the general surgical service with 
                                 biliary sepsis and high spiking fevers. While febrile, the patient is 
                                 noted by the clinician to be disoriented and confused. This patient 
                                 has an impaired sensorium.  
                                 
                                 Example: A long-term resident of a VA nursing home with chronic 
                                 schizophrenia is admitted for an elective hernia repair. He is noted 
                                 to have long-standing mental status changes and is chronically 
                                 disoriented to place, time, and person. Although this patient has 
                                 disorientation, his mental status changes are long-standing, chronic, 
                                 and unchanged and would not qualify for "impaired sensorium." 
                                 
                                 Note: These examples would apply only if noted within 48 hours prior 
                                 to surgery

                                 (1) Has spread to one site or more sites in addition to the primary 
                                     site

                                 (2) In whom the presence of multiple metastases indicates the cancer 
                                     is widespread, fulminant, or near terminal. Other terms describing 
                                     disseminated cancer include "diffuse," "widely metastatic," 
                                     "widespread," or "carcinomatosis", or AJCC "Stage IV" cancer.  
                                     Common sites of metastases include major organs (e.g., brain, 
                                     lung, liver, meninges, abdomen, peritoneum, pleura, bone).  
                                     
                                     Report Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myelogenous 
                                     Leukemia (AML) under this variable. Do not report Chronic

                                 Example: A patient with a primary breast cancer with positive nodes in 
                                 the axilla does NOT qualify for this definition. She has spread of the 
                                 tumor to a site other than the primary site, but does not have 
                                 widespread metastases. A patient with primary breast cancer with 
                                 positive nodes in the axilla AND liver metastases does qualify, 
                                 because she has both spread of the tumor to the axilla and other major 
                                 organs.  
                                 
                                 Example: A patient with colon cancer and no positive nodes or distant 
                                 metastases does NOT qualify. A patient with colon cancer and several 
                                 local lymph nodes positive for tumor, but no other evidence of 
                                 metastatic disease does NOT qualify. A patient with colon cancer with 
                                 liver metastases and/or peritoneal seeding with tumor does qualify.  
                                 
                                 Example: A patient with adenocarcinoma of the prostate confined to the 
                                 capsule does NOT qualify. A patient with prostate cancer that extends 
                                 through the capsule of the prostate only does NOT qualify. A patient 
                                 with prostate cancer with bony metastases DOES qualify.

              DESCRIPTION:      CICSP Definition (2004): Indicate the most severe percent stenosis in the right coronary artery. Include the proximal third of the posterior descending coronary artery. The right coronary artery initially runs in the 
                                groove between the right ventricle and right atrium; it usually gives off branches to both the right and left ventricles and the right atrium. The branches to the right atrium (sinus node artery) and right ventricle (conus
                                branch and acute marginal branches) are commonly ignored when describing coronary artery disease. However, the right coronary artery is the most common source for the posterior descending coronary artery and often
                                gives-off branches to the posterior-lateral free wall of the left ventricle. These are often known as left ventricular extension branches and are considered branches of the circumflex for the coding of severity of coronary 
                                disease. If there is no obstruction of these coronary arteries, indicate zero. Entering "NS" for "No Study/Unknown" is also allowed.

              DESCRIPTION:      CICSP Definition (2004): Indicate the most severe percent stenosis in the circumflex coronary artery, including marginal branches and ramus intermedius considered to be of adequate size for bypass grafting. Both the
                                anatomy and nomenclature for describing the circumflex coronary artery can be confusing -- in part, because of the marked variability from patient to patient. The true circumflex lies in the groove separating the left 
                                atrium from the left ventricle (A-V groove) for a variable distance following its origination from the left main coronary artery.  Typically, it gives-off one or more branches that leave the A-V groove to supply the
                                posterior-lateral free wall of the left ventricle. These are known as marginal branches. A few patients have a branch to the posterior-lateral free wall of the left ventricle arising exactly at the bifurcation of the left
                                main coronary artery into the left anterior descending coronary artery and the circumflex coronary artery. Strictly speaking, this vessel is neither a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery nor a
                                marginal branch of the circumflex coronary artery. This is often called the "ramus intermedius" or "trifurcation branch". If there is no obstruction of these coronary arteries, indicate zero. Entering "NS" for "No

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the code describing presence/severity of mitral regurgitation. 
              DESCRIPTION:      CICSP Definition (2004): Indicate the severity of any mitral regurgitation documented for the patient. This question should be answered using either the left ventricular angiogram or the cardiac ultrasound examination.  
                                Adjectives used to describe the severity of the mitral regurgitation on the cardiac cath report should be converted to a four-point scale: 1+ = mild, 2 or 3+ = moderate, and 4+ = severe.  
                                 
                                Diagnosis by angiogram: 
                                =======================
                                The following definitions should be used to assess the presence/severity of mitral regurgitation based on the interpretation of the contrast left ventricular angiogram: 
                                 
                                None/Trivial - There is no visible systolic regurgitation across the mitral valve. Trace or trivial notations of mitral regurgitation should be listed as none.  
                                 
                                Mild - Definite contrast can be seen in the left atrium following left ventricular injection, but the left atrium never fills to the same opacity as the left ventricle.  
                                 
                                Moderate - The left atrium fills to the same opacity as the left ventricle over two or more systoles.  
                                 
                                Severe - The left atrium fills to the same opacity as the left ventricle over a single systole.  
                                 
                                NS - If unable to make an assessment of the patient's left ventricular contraction grade or no study was performed, entering "NS" for "No Study/Unknown" is also allowed.  
                                 
                                Diagnosis by cardiac ultrasound: 
                                ================================ 
                                The following definitions are commonly used to assess the presence/severity of mitral regurgitation based on the interpretation of the cardiac ultrasound examination: 
                                 
                                None/Trivial - No regurgitant jet is seen on the Doppler study. Trace or trivial notations of mitral regurgitation should be listed as none.  
                                 
                                Mild - The area of the regurgitant jet is 0 - 4 cm2.  
                                 
                                Moderate - The area of the regurgitant jet is >4 - 8 cm2.  
                                 
                                Severe - The area of the regurgitant jet is greater than 8 cm2 or greater than one third of the total left atrial area.  
                                 
                                NS - If no study was performed, entering "NS" for "No Study/Unknown" is also allowed.

                                     widespread, fulminant, or near terminal. Other terms describing 
                                     disseminated cancer include "diffuse," "widely metastatic," 
                                     "widespread," or "carcinomatosis" or AJCC "Stage IV" cancer. Common 
                                     sites of metastases include major organs (e.g., brain, lung, liver, 
                                     meninges, abdomen, peritoneum, pleura, bone).  
                                 
                                Example: A patient with a primary breast cancer with positive nodes in the axilla does NOT qualify for this definition. She has spread of the tumor to a site other than the primary site, but does not have widespread
                                metastases. A patient with primary breast cancer with positive nodes in the axilla AND liver metastases does qualify, because she has both spread of the tumor to the axilla and other major organs.  
                                 
                                Example: A patient with colon cancer and no positive nodes or distant metastases does NOT qualify. A patient with colon cancer and several local lymph nodes positive for tumor, but no other evidence of metastatic disease
                                does NOT qualify. A patient with colon cancer with liver metastases and/or peritoneal seeding with tumor does qualify.  
                                 
                                Example: A patient with adenocarcinoma of the prostate confined to the capsule does NOT qualify. A patient with prostate cancer that extends through the capsule of the prostate only does NOT qualify. A patient with
                                prostate cancer with bony metastases DOES qualify.

                                response is appropriate. A "no" response is also appropriate if the primary operation is to insert a ventricular assist device.

                                     due to decision made prior to operation to perform some vessels 
                                     off-pump and some on-pump in order to minimize total CPB time.  Yes, unplanned - The procedure was begun as an off-pump procedure but 
                                     changed to on-pump for any length of time; the change was 
                                     unplanned and determined in the operating room due to inability 
                                     to safely perform revascularization.  NS/Unknown - If documentation is not sufficient to answer, entering

              DESCRIPTION:      CICSP Definition (2004): Indicate whether the patient's cardiac surgery was performed in a non-VA facility through a contracted arrangement, even if part of the post-surgical care is provided at the VA.  A "contract"
                                facility is one established to be an affiliate with the VA medical center, and it is most typically a University Hospital.  In rare cases a "contract" facility may be a community hospital when there is no University 
                                affiliate for the VAMC.  By contrast, a "fee-basis" patient surgery should not be indicated as a "contract" facility.  Typically, a "fee-basis" establishment is an agreement by the VA Chief of Staff to out-source a patient
                                to a community hospital.  That hospital then bills the Chief of Staff for care rendered on the patient.  CICSP does not wish to capture the patient data on the "fee-basis" patients. If the patient is not entered into
                                VISTA, send a paper form to Denver for hand-entry, unless your facility contracts-out a majority of its cases.  Enter "NS" if funding for the procedure is not known. The default is to NO if a response is not entered.

                                Numbers may be converted to describe the severity of the aortic stenosis on the cardiac cath report to the adjectives describing the severity: 1+ = mild, 2 or 3+ = moderate, and 4+ = severe. Both transvalvular gradient and
                                estimated valve orifice area are used to assess the severity of obstruction (stenosis) of a valve. The transvalvular pressure gradient is obtained by converting the velocity of blood flow across the valve measured by the
                                Doppler principle to pressure drop using the Bernoulli equation. The pressure drop, which is dependent on flow, can be converted to estimated valve orifice area if flow is known. If the echo report uses an adjective to
                                describe the severity of stenosis, indicate the corresponding adjective. Use the following to convert mean (not peak) transvalvular gradients, orifice areas, or both, to the descriptive categories. Indicate the one most

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the level of self care that summarizes the patient's status prior to surgery. 
              DESCRIPTION:      NSQIP Definition (2008): This is a question that focuses on the patient's abilities to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) in the 30 days prior to surgery. Activities of daily living are defined as 'the activities
                                usually performed in the course of a normal day in a person's life'. ADLs include: bathing, feeding, dressing, toileting, and mobility. Report the corresponding level of self-care for activities of daily living 
                                demonstrated by this patient at the time the patient is being considered as a candidate for surgery (which should be no longer than 30 days prior to surgery). If the patient's status changes prior to surgery, that change
                                should be reflected in your assessment. For this time point, report the level of functional health status as defined by the following criteria.  
                                 
                                 (1) Independent: The patient does not require assistance from another 
                                     person for any activities of daily living. This includes a person 
                                     who is able to function independently with prosthetics, equipment, 
                                     or devices.  
                                 (2) Partially dependent: The patient requires some assistance from 
                                     another person for activities of daily living. This includes a 
                                     person who utilizes prosthetics, equipment, or devices but still 
                                     requires some assistance from another person for ADLs.  
                                 (3) Totally dependent: The patient requires total assistance for all 
                                     activities of daily living.  
                                 (4) Unknown: If unable to ascertain the functional status for the time 
                                     point of 'prior to the current illness' only, report as unknown.  
                                 
                                All patients with psychiatric illnesses should be evaluated for their ability to function with or without assistance with ADLs just as the non-psychiatric patient. For instance, if a patient with schizophrenia is able to
                                care for him/herself without the assistance of nursing care, he/she is considered independent.

              DESCRIPTION:      CICSP Definition (2006): Indicate if patient had a Maze procedure either with or without placing the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A Maze procedure is a surgical intervention used to interrupt abnormal atrial
                                conduction pathways that cause atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It may be performed alone or in combination with other cardiac procedures. (A Maze does not include an amputation/resection of the atrial appendage as
                                an isolated procedure; an intraoperative electrophysiologic mapping procedure; nor any surgical or ablation procedure conducted on the ventricle for control of ventricular arrhythmias.) Indicate the one most appropriate 
                                response: 
                                 
                                No - No Maze performed 
                                 
                                Full Maze - The procedure is most often performed on-bypass through a median sternotomy. A combination of incisions and thermal (cryo) or radiofrequency ablations of the atrial wall pathways are done, typically including
                                amputation/resection of the one or both atrial appendices. The procedure thus creates a "maze" of electrical propogation roots involving the entire atrial myocardium with only one side of entrance (the sinus node) and one
                                side of exit (the AV node).  
                                 
                                Mini-Maze - A more limited and simpler procedure than the traditional full maze, the Mini-Maze is based on the finding that in most patients, ectopic foci located in the pulmonary veins are responsible for the initiation
                                of atrial fib.  Radiofrequency or a cryo-ablation probe is used either inside or outside of the pulmonary vein ostia to destroy the foci.  It can be performed with or without resection of the atrial appendage and includes
                                no incision or minimal incisions to the left atrium, rather than the extensive atrial surgical procedure conducted for the full Maze.  The Mini can be performed on or off bypass through a median sternotomy or performed
                                thorascopically to the outside of the pulmonary veins.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the Mallampati Scale class. 
              DESCRIPTION:      NSQIP Definition (2004): The Mallampati classification relates tongue size to pharyngeal size.  This test is performed with the patient in sitting position, the head held in a neutral position, the mouth wide open, and the
                                tongue protruding to the maximum. The subsequent classification is assigned based upon the pharyngeal structures that are visible: 
                                 
                                Class I   - visualization of the soft palate, fauces, uvula, and 
                                            anterior and posterior pillars.  Class II  - visualization of the soft palate, fauces, and uvula.  Class III - visualization of the soft palate and the base of the uvula.  Class IV  - soft palate is not visible
                                at all.  
                                 
                                The classification assigned by the clinician may vary if the patient is in the supine position (instead of sitting). If the patient phonates, this falsely improves the view. If the patient arches his or her tongue, the
                                uvula is falsely obscured. A class I view suggests ease of intubation and correlates with a laryngoscopic view grade I 99 to 100% of the time.  Class IV view suggests a poor laryngoscopic view, grade III or IV 100% of the
                                time. Refer to the Operations Manual for a visual depiction of the Mallampati Classification.
