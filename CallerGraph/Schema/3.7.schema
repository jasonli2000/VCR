This file holds pointers to the message file, according to users.  Each mailbox entry corresponds to a user.  POSTMASTER is a special user who controls the network communications queues.  Each user is automatically given two baskets: IN and  WASTE.  All
incoming messages go into the users IN basket.  When the user deletes them, they are temporarily stored in the WASTE basket.   Users may create new baskets as they wish.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is where users store their messages.  Each user is automatically given an IN basket (#1), and a WASTE basket (#.5) when they first use MailMan.  These are permanent, and may not be deleted by the user.  Other baskets
                                may be created by the user, and also deleted. 
                                 
                                Deleted messages are placed in the WASTE basket temporarily.  Every evening the WASTE basket is emptied.  
                                 
                                USERS SHOULD MANIPULATE BASKETS ONLY WITH MAILMAN; NOT TRY TO DO IT MANUALLY WITH FILEMAN.

                  DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to flag messages that need to be transmitted before or after all other messages in a queue.  
                                     
                                    Messages in the queue which are flagged as HIGH priority are transmitted before all other messages.  
                                     
                                    Messages in the queue which are flagged as REGULAR priority (default) are transmitted next.  
                                     
                                    Messages in the queue which are flagged as LOW priority are transmitted after all other messages.  
                                     
                                    Messages with the same priority are transmitted in IEN order, which is not necessarily the order in which they appear in the transmit queue.  
                                     
                                    Only the POSTMASTER (or surrogate) may change the priority of a message in a transmit queue.  If, during a transmission, MailMan has problems with a particular message, MailMan may flag that message as LOW priority, so
                                    that other messages in the queue will transmit, before the problem message is attempted again.  
                                     
                                    Changes to message priorities can be made even while a queue is being transmitted.

                                When the user logs on and has new messages, he is told how many, and when the last one arrived.  If he logs off without reading those messages and logs on again, and hasn't received any further new messages, he is told how

                                The first, XM FWD ADDRESS CHANGE, notifies responsible individuals (belonging to the mail group associated with the bulletin) that a user has changed his forwarding address.  This is the "official" bulletin of this cross
                                reference.  
                                 
                                The second, XM FWD ADDRESS CHECK, is sent to the user's new forwarding address as test to see if the address is valid.  If it's not valid, the sender (the Postmaster) will receive an error message.  This bulletin has been
                                piggy-backed onto the "official" bulletin.  FileMan is not aware of this.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Do you want to see a preview of the message subject and sender? 
              DESCRIPTION:      This applies to the Classic reader only.  
                                 
                                When you are scrolling through the messages in a basket, you can choose whether or not MailMan should display (preview) the message subject and sender before you read the message.  
                                 
                                Enter Y to see the preview; N not to.  If you don't enter anything, you will not see a preview.  
                                 
                                Seeing the message subject and sender may help you decide whether or not you wish to read the message.  If you decide not to read the message, you can "Ignore" it and move on to the next message.  
                                 
                                The following is a sample dialogue showing message preview:

                                The following is a sample dialogue without message preview.  It is more difficult to decide whether to read the message or to ignore it.

              DESCRIPTION:      Answer 'Ask', and MailMan will prompt you each time you read a PRIORITY mail message, to find out if you want the future responses to that message to be delivered as PRIORITY mail.  The default answer will be whatever you
                                answered before for that message, or if it's a new message, whatever you have entered in PRIORITY RESPONSES FLAG.  
                                 
                                Answer 'Do not ask', and MailMan will not bother you with such requests for information, but will use whatever you have entered in PRIORITY RESPONSES FLAG.  
                                 
                                In either case you may toggle the value of this field by typing KPRIORITY at the message action prompt.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3-30 characters in length. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This is the name of your filter.  The filter is used by MailMan to determine into which basket to place a message.  Messages can be filtered based on up to three criteria which must all be true: 
                                   - Subject contains 
                                   - Message is from 
                                   - Message is to 
                                   
                                  For example, if you specify 'subject contains' and 'message is from', the filter takes effect only if the subject contains the string you specify AND the message is from the person you specify. 
                                   
                                  If you wish the filter to take effect upon 'subject contains' OR 'message is from' you must create two filters, one with 'subject contains', and the other with 'message is from'.  
                                   
                                  Filtering takes place during message delivery and can also be selected as a basket action.  The filter is ignored during delivery under the following conditions: 
                                   - The message already exists in one of your baskets.  
                                   - The message is from you, and you specified a basket (other than the IN basket) at the transmit prompt.  
                                   - The sender has specified a delivery basket and you have allowed it.

                                  The basket may not be the "IN" basket, because that is the default basket.  
                                   
                                  The basket must exist (or be created) at the time you specify it.  You may delete this basket later.  If a message filters to this basket, and the basket does not exist, the basket will be created.

              DESCRIPTION:      You have chosen a default 'message reader' in the previous selection.  You chose either the 'classic' reader or one of the 'full-screen' readers.  (If you didn't choose, then your default is the 'classic' reader.) 
                                 
                                In this selection, you must decide whether you want MailMan to ask you every time you use the message reader which reader to use, or not to ask you and just go ahead and use your default message reader.  
                                 
                                Answer 'Yes' if you want to be prompted for your reader choice every time you go to read messages in a basket.  This is the default answer, and is recommended until you have tried all the readers and decided that you want 
                                to settle on using just one.  
                                 
                                Answer 'No' if you don't want to be prompted, and you just want to use your default reader every time.
