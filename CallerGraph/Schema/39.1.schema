This file contains the various card types which are printed on embossers.  The parameters of each card, i.e., what prints where, are defined in this file for each card type. 
 
This file has a .001 field and is, therefore, IEN dependent.  It should not be altered at the site level.  The DGQE* routines depend on the entries in the file to remain stable.

                                for each card type (Service Connected, Non-Service Connected, Non-Veteran, Free Text, etc.)..  
                                 
                                The computer site manager should set this field to YES to automatically place the cards in 'Hold' status, to NO to automatically 'Print' the cards immediately, or to ASK to ask the user to 'Print' or 'Hold'.  If this field
                                is not edited, the system defaults to ASK.
