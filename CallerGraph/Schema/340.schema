                                This cross-reference allows rapid look-up of debtors in the debtor file by the 'type' of debtor.  There are five types of debtors (Patient, Insurance Company, Institution, Vendor, and Person).  This allows the AR software
                                to scan the file for only a specific type of debtor rather than having to look at each entry.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to determine the amount of detail to be displayed on the patient statement for RX Copay charges.  A site can define brief or detailed information for each patient to be displayed on the statement.  Brief
                                information consists only of the RX # and Fill date, while the expanded information consists of much more (Physician, drug name, etc.).

              DESCRIPTION:      A statement day is assigned to all types of debtors, except insurance companies.  A statement day is the day that a patient statement is generated or a follow-up letter is generated for non-benefit debts.  The AR package
                                will hold 'notifications' from being sent until the debtors 'statement day' arrives.  This allows all activity since the previous statement to print and update the debtor on the account activity.  
                                 
                                Patient statement days never change, but Institution, Person, and Vendor statement days are changed by the AR software.  When these type debtors have a new active bill, the date the new active bill is created becomes their
                                'statement day'.  This statement day remains in effect until no active bills exist for the debtor, at which time the statement day is 'deleted'.  
                                 
                                Insurance companies are notified based on a bill-specific date.  Since insurance companies have much more activity, they are notified on a constant basis depending on each individual bill 'due-date'.

                                This cross-reference is used to print patient statements and Vendor, Person, and Institution follow-up letters.  Since these type of debtors get notified based on their statement day, this cross-reference allows rapid
                                look-up of which debtor is due a notification on a particular day.
