This file contains data which is used in DRG Grouper calculations. These data specify combinations of diagnosis codes that, when found to occur together in one patient case, will lead to a specific DRG code. The DRG Grouper routines will check the
contents of the "One Of" field and each "With One Of" field to make this determination.

82.12,1       BLOCK                  BL;0 Multiple #82.121 (Add New Entry without Asking)

              DESCRIPTION:      This multiple contains blocks of specific combinations of diagnoses (located in the "ONE OF" and the "WITH ONE OF n" multiples), which, when found to occur together for a patient, confirm that the patient has the specific
                                patient case identified in the IDENTIFIER CODE (#.01) field. It also supplies the DRGs (located in the "MDC" multiple) associated with the patient case. 
                                 
                                Patient cases are divided in such a way that any one BLOCK has to be satisfied. For a BLOCK to be satisfied, at least one diagnosis code from each code set should have match with patient's diagnosis codes.  Whichever BLOCK
                                is satisfied, we get DRG, MDC from that BLOCK.

                                  Diagnosis Code exists in this multiple and also exists in each of the "With One Of" multiples that are present, then it confirms the DRG code in the IDENTIFIER CODE (#.01) field of this record. There will always be at 
                                  least one Diagnosis Code in the "One Of" multiple, and at least one Diagnosis Code in the "With One Of 1" multiple, but the "With One Of 2", "With One Of 3" and "With One Of 4" multiples may be empty.
