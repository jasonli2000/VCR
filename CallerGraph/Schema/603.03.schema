This file contains various parameters for the Clozapine rollup.  No option is assigned for the sites to manipulate the data. This file is used and maintained by the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) through the YSCLSERVER option.  The
TRANSMISSION DAY field forces all of the sites to transmit on the same day, in the past we had to allow scattered reporting due to network limits.  We no longer have this problem.  All transmissions will occur on Tuesday unless the NCCC in Dallas wishes
to change the day.  The DEBUG MODE field allows data to be transmitted to a test location without contaminating the database in Hines. The three date fields TRANSMISSION START, TRANSMISSION END and LAST DEMOGRAPHICS TRANSMISSION report back to the NCCC
through the server.
