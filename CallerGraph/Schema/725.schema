This file contains a set of nationally defined procedures for use in the Event Capture software. These procedures are necessary for data collection in DSS that are not represented in the CPT file (#81). These procedures were defined by the Decision
Support System (DSS) Program Office or its designee.  
 
Entries in this file are standard procedures that should not be edited or deleted. Options exist within the Event Capture Management Menu that provide users the tools to add locally recognized procedures to this file. These local entries will be added,
by the using the Event Capture software, at internal entry number above 90,000.  
 
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.
