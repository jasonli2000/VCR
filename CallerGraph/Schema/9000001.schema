This file is IHS's primary patient data file.  The NAME (.01) field of this file is a pointer to the VA's patient file (#2).  Fields in common between the two dictionaries actually exist only in the VA patient file and are referenced by the IHS patient
file as computed fields.  All other files containing patient data have backward pointers linking them to this file.  The linkage is by patient name and the internal FileMan gener- ated number of the ancillary file is the same number used in this file.  
   
All applications developed for the RPMS which require patient data will point to this file.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field points to the Patient file (#2) and has the same internal number as that file.  Thus, the patient's name is the Patient file (#2) name.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is populated in the VA when a new patient is added to the ^DPT file by the PX09 cross-reference on the Social Security Number (.09) field of ^DPT.  
                                  
                                Any merging of patients in ^DPT by a VAMC should include this PATIENT/IHS  file in its merging process.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This multiple contains the different health record identifiers by facility.  IHS uses a 6 character identifier.  The VA uses the social security number which may be up to 10 characters.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                This multiple is used for Multi-Facility Integration (MFI) processing at IHS facilities.

                HELP-PROMPT:      ENTER NAME OF FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEALTH RECORD NUMBER YOU WISH TO ENTER. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This field is a pointer to the LOCATION file.  The internal pointer is forced into the third subscript for the 9000001.41 subfile.  This allows easy lookup by health record number for the logged on location (facility).  
                                   
                                  The complete subscript for 9000001.41 will be (DFN,41,facility pointer,0).  

                TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                  In the VA, the Kernel Site Parameters DEFAULT INSTITUTION field is used to populate this field.  This was used instead of the users institution because of regional users ability to add patients to the VA.

                                  This field is used by the IHS Multi-Facility Integration (MFI) package to determine whether to stop integrating data at a facility for a particular patient and location facility.
