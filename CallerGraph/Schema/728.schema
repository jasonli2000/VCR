This file contains various data extract information utilized by the DSS Extracts software.  This data includes the last date an extract was run, the Austin queue receiving the extract data, and extract setup information.  
 
Data in this file should be entered and edited only by using the DSS software and not by direct access via VA FileMan.  
 
**TECH NOTE** When adding a new extract, make sure that the "LAST DATE XXX" is on same piece of the 7 node as the "XXX" field is on the 7.1 node.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter "YES" if you are ready to send LMIP Codes for LAB Extract. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is a flag that indicates whether a facility is ready to send LMIP codes for the LAB Extract. To answer "YES" to this question, the site must be able to answer "YES" to BOTH of the following questions: 
                                 
                                1. They are in DSS Implementation Round 5 or higher, OR they are in IR1 
                                   through IR4 and are extracting data for FY97 or beyond.  2. All Lab CO directives for LMIP have been completed at their facility.  
                                   This means that their Lab Service has matched all entries in the 
                                   LABORATORY TEST file (#60) to an LMIP code and therefore they are 
                                   ready to use the new DSS LAB Extract version that sends only the LMIP 
                                   codes to DSS for their initial LAB Feeder Key Values.  
                                 
                                **NOTE** Once this field is set to "YES", the facility is not asked any of these questions again and will automatically use the new DSS LAB Extract version for all future extracts.
