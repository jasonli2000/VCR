                DESCRIPTION:
                                  The value of this field is a single upper case letter.  This letter identifies a FIFO queue that is being processed on a DICOM Text Gateway.  There are 16 such queues (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y and Z).

                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the current sequence number in this queue. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is an integer number that identifies the entry in the FIFO queue that will be processed next.  The initial value for this field is 9999999.  When, during normal processing, this number would be
                                  incremented to a value larger then 9999999, the number will be reset to 0.
