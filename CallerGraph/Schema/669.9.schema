This file holds the list of parameters which can change the operation of the prosthetics package at a site.  It should be noted that these parameters are generally copied into a local variable when entering the prosthetics program.  This means that, in
general, a change to this file will not take effect until the users currently using the package leave the prosthetics system and come back into it again.  This file may have one or more entries.  During the installation process, some of the parameters
for the first site may be set for you.  Never edit or delete the AMIS GROUPER field.  Never delete an entry in this file, only edit it.
