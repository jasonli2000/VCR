              DESCRIPTION:      If there is data in this field, it will become part of the Dosage selection display in CPRS for Local Possible Dosages, for Dispense Drugs matched to a Pharmacy Orderable Item with this Dose Form. It will connect the Local 
                                Possible Dosage with the Strength and Units. For example, a Local Possible Dosage of '2 drop(s) 0.5%' becomes '2 drop(s) of 0.5%' by adding the word 'of' as the conjunction for the Dosage Form.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter '1' or 'YES' if drugs with this Dosage Form should be excluded from dosage checks. 
              DESCRIPTION:      If this field is set to '1' or 'YES', then any medication orders containing a drug with this Dosage Form will be excluded from dosage checks. However, if the VA PRODUCT (#50.68) File entry that the DRUG (#50) File entry is
                                matched to has a '1' or 'Yes' in the OVERRIDE DF DOSE CHK EXCLUSION (#31) Field, the Dosage Form exclusion designation would be overridden, and dosage checks would be performed for Drug (#50) File entries matched to that
                                VA product. If this field is set to '0' or 'No', or null, then any medication orders containing a drug with this Dosage Form will not be excluded from dosage checks. However, if the VA PRODUCT (#50.68) File entry that the
                                Drug (#50) File entry is matched to has a '1' or 'Yes' in the OVERRIDE DF DOSE CHK EXCLUSION (#31) Field, the Dosage Form exclusion designation would be overridden, and dosage checks would not be performed for Drug (#50)
                                File entries matched to that VA product.
