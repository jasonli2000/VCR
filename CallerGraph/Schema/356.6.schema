              DESCRIPTION:      This is the name of the type of event that can be stored in Claims Tracking.  Only certain types of events or visits are known to Claims Tracking.  Adding or deleting entries can have unwanted effects on the IB package. 
                                Currently only inpatient, outpatient, prosthetics, and Rx Refill visits are known to IB.  Future plans call for adding Fee Basis visits.  This is limited to those areas that we currently have legislative authority to bill.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter "YES" if this type of entry can be automatically billed. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This will control the automated creation of bills for each type of care.  
                                 
                                If this is "Y"es then the Earliest Auto Bill date will be automatically added to billable events.  These events can then be added to bills by the automated biller.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>9999)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 02, 1993 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 9999, 0 Decimal Digits.  Enter the number of days in the billing cycle for this type of claim. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the maximum number of days allowed on a single bill for this type of care.  
                                 
                                For example, if outpatient bills have a billing cycle of 7 days then one bill will be created for a seven day period, which may contain 1 visit or seven.  
                                 
                                If this is left blank and the event type can be automatically billed then the bills will be created in one month intervals.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>99)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 02, 1993 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 99, 0 Decimal Digits.  Enter the number of days after a billing cycle completes that the Automated Biller should run. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the minimum number of days delay that apparently billable visits (for this type of event type) should wait for auto billing.  
                                 
                                This field works in conjunction with the field BILLING CYCLE to determine what visits are included on a bill and when those bills can be created.
