              DESCRIPTION:      The RECENT Exams list shows all exams having a Status of Interpreted or Transcribed.  The list can be further restricted to show only exams up to 'N' days old--use this field to define a value for 'N'.  Note that for most
                                sites, Exams are likely to be marked Complete within 3 to 4 working days of being Interpreted, at which point they no longer show up on the RECENT Exams list.  If NOT defined, the system defaults to  a value of 6.

              HELP-PROMPT:      The Unread Exams list will not display exams older than the number of days you specify. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The UNREAD Exams list shows all exams having a Status of EXAMINED.  The list can be further restricted to show only exams up to 'N' days old--use this field to define a value for 'N'.  If NOT defined, the system defaults 
                                to a value of 30.

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 21, 1998 
              HELP-PROMPT:      To Enable Prefetch of prior exams' images from archive, enter YES. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Exam images that have been archived, e.g. to jukebox storage, may be retrieved to magnetic disk at the time a new exam is registered for a patient.  Enabling this allows immediate retrieval of the patient's prior exams
                                when the radiologist is ready to read the new exam.  


2006.69,4     AUTODISPLAY ACTIVE?    0;6 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 21, 1998 
              HELP-PROMPT:      To enable Auto-display of prior exams' images enter YES. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Enabling this turns on automatic retrieval and display of the patient's prior exams when the radiologist reads a new exam.  


2006.69,5     LIST ONLY EXAMS HAVING IMAGES? 0;7 SET

                                '0' FOR NO; 
                                '1' FOR YES; 
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 25, 1998 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'NO' to list ALL exams, 'YES' to list only exams that have images.    This applies only to UNREAD, ACTIVE, PENDING, and ALL EXAMS lists. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Some sites may have a mix of exams that do, and do not, have images stored digitally.  In this case, the UNREAD, ACTIVE and PENDING exams lists may be optionally configured to either list only the exams that have images 
                                available for display on the VistaRad workstation, or to list all exams, including those that do not have images available for display.  NOTE that the Patient Exams List always lists ALL exams, regardless of whether images
                                exist or not.  


2006.69,5.5   ENABLE SERIES DISPLAY? 0;12 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 20, 1999 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer YES to turn on image display of multiple Series within one exam. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The Vistarad Viewer code is not yet able to distinguish between different image series within one exam.  However, the back-end code often can determine which images in a study may be grouped into separate series, and can
                                feed image information to the viewer that allow it to recognize and display these separate series in separate "exam" windows.  This prompt allows the Vistarad site to turn this processing on or off.  


2006.69,6     BACKGROUND COMPILE EXAM LISTS? 0;8 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      FEB 23, 2000 
              HELP-PROMPT:      To compile Exam Lists in the background, enter desired value. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The process of compiling UNREAD & RECENT exam lists from the radiology database may be relatively lengthy.  To enable these lists to reach the radiology workstation rapidly, they can be compiled periodically in the
                                background on the Vista system.  Enabling this option generally should provide for very fast retrieval of the exam lists.  Note, however, that on the UNREAD Exams list the most recently completed ("EXAMINED") exams may not
                                appear on the list, up to a time limit defined below; however, exams that are "INTERPRETED" will be dropped from the UNREAD list, even in between compiles.  UNREAD compiles are automatically started by requesting an UNREAD
                                Exams list at the workstation.  The background program is initiated via an internal TaskMan call, but it will run continuously in the background after being initiated. The RECENT compile is initiated using the TaskMan 
                                Scheduled Options capability.  The Option to schedule is MAGJ SCHED RECENT LIST COMPILE; it is recommended that this process be scheduled to run every 30 to 90 minutes.  


2006.69,7     UNREAD BKGND COMPILE INTERVAL 0;9 NUMBER

              BACKGROUND COMPILE INTERVAL--UNREAD LIST                                                                         
              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>15)!(X<2)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      MAR 07, 2000 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 2 and 15, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      If compiling exams lists in the background, this field is used to define the number of minutes to wait in between each successive compile of the UNREAD Exams List.  If not specified, the default value used will be 6 
                                minutes.  For sites that tend to have more than 100 Unread exams on average, it is recommended to use a value of 3 or 4 minutes; less than 100, use 2 or 3 minutes.  


2006.69,7.2   RECENT BKGND COMPILE INTERVAL 0;13 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>240)!(X<30)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      APR 05, 2000 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 30 and 240, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      The Recent List Background Compile is managed by Taskman, where a Scheduled Option should be defined for periodically compiling this list (recommended to compile every two to three hours).  Use this field to let VistARad
                                know what you have defined in TaskMan as the interval between compiles.  This value is used to provide a warning message to the VistaRad user should it appear that the Background Compile has not run for more than this
                                expected interval of time.  Obviously, this field only is useful if BACKGROUND COMPILE EXAM LISTS has been Enabled.  


2006.69,8     REMOTE LIST ONLY REMOTE CACHE? 0;10 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      DEC 22, 1998 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'NO' to list ALL exams, 'YES' to list only exams that were routed to the remote site. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This question only applies to sites that use the Imaging Routing Gateway to route images to a remote facility for reading.  
                                 
                                At the remote reading workstation, the Unread & Recent Exams lists may display either all exams, or only the subset of the exams that have been routed to the remote site. Enter YES to display only the routed exams.  


2006.69,9     SITE SENDS TO REMOTE CACHE 0;11 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      MAR 19, 1999 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES if this site routes images to remote locations. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This question only applies to sites that use the Imaging Routing Gateway to route images to a remote facility for reading.  
                                 
                                Answering this question YES turns on extra processing that is needed to manage the remote exams properly in VistARad.  


2006.69,10    PATIENT LIST LIMIT # YEARS 0;14 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>20)!(X<2)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      FEB 15, 2000 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter Number of Years back to limit the Patient Exams List, from 2 to 20. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The Patient Exams List can display a subset of all a patient's exams, limited by how old the exams are.  This field is used to specify how far back in time the patient list should go before stopping.  NOTE that the user
                                does have a separate option to list ALL the patient's exams, regardless of the setting of this field.  NOT entering a value will force the Patient Exams List to go back to the earliest exams on record for a patient. 
                                Greater efficiency in compiling this list is achieved by limiting the number of years to a "most useful" value (clinically speaking).  


2006.69,11    PATIENT LIST LIMIT # EXAMS 0;15 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>75)!(X<15)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      FEB 15, 2000 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the maximum number of exams to list for a patient, from 15 to 75. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The Patient Exams List can display a subset of all a patient's exams, limited by a maximum number of exams to display. This field is used to specify the maximum to list before stopping.  NOTE that the user does have a
                                separate option to list ALL the patient's exams, regardless of the setting of this field.  NOT entering a value will force the Patient Exams List to list all exams in the defined time period for a patient.  


2006.69,12    REQUISITION FOR RAD STAFF ONLY 0;16 SET

                                '1' FOR Y; 
              LAST EDITED:      FEB 17, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES to restrict access to the Requisition report. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Setting this value to YES will prevent non-radiology personnel from viewing the Radiology Requisition from Vistarad.  Some sites have data that appears on the requisition which is strictly for internal radiology staff use. 
                                This prompt provides a way to restrict access to that report.  


2006.69,20    UNREAD LIST PRIORITY SEQ 1;E1,245 FREE TEXT

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  S X=$TR(X,"supr;. ","SUPR,,") K:'((X?1U1","1U1","1U1","1U)&($F(X,"R")&$F(X,"S")&$F(X,"P")&$F(X,"U"))) X
              LAST EDITED:      FEB 22, 1999 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 7 characters in length, using the letters S, U, P & R; enter ?? for more help. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The Unread lists show a column, PRIORITY, that is typically used as a sort item for the list.  Four values are possible (from the Radiology Exam order, file 75.1).  This field allows the site to define the preferred sort
                                ordering for these 4 values.  The default order is: 
                                   Stat, Urgent, Pre-op, Routine To achieve this ordering, the value for this field would be specified: 
                                   S,U,P,R Any sequence of these 4 letters may be defined, and then will be used by the list program.
