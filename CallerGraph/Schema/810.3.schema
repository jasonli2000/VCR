This file stores compliance totals found for a specific extract.  The extract Entries are read only and may be selected by number or extract name. The extract Summary entries are currently created from two types of processing: 1) Generic EXTRACT tool
manual runs and automated runs 2) LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN and LREPI NIGHTLY TASK on day 15 of each month 
 
Generic extract summary entries: 
 
The REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY NAME is the combination of a unique abbreviation.  When the extract is created from the EXTRACT manual and automated options, the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY NAME will include Q, M, or Y (for quarterly, monthly, or yearly), nn
for month or quarter, and yyyy for year. The following is an example of extract names: 
     VA-IHD QUERI 2006 M2     
     VA-IHD QUERI 2006 M1    
     VA-IHD QUERI 2005 M12     
 
National extract summary entries created from generic Reminder Extract functionality (not LREPI) are stored with a VA- prefixed name.  Each extract entry contains reminder compliance totals for each unique combination of patient list and reminder.  The
extract will optionally store finding compliance totals if the TYPE OF TOTALS for the extract is "Compliance and Finding Totals". No patient specific data is stored in the extract summary file for generic extracts.  The patient lists (denominators) used
to create the extract summary totals, for a particular reporting period, are available from Reminder Patient List options.  
 
Generic extract summary entries will default to be purged after 5 years.  The automated purge status can be changed for a particular extract summary entry to retain the entry indefinitely.  
 
LREPI extract summary entries: 
 
The LREPI extract names use YY/MM representing the ending year and month of the extract date range, and the run date in the format YYMMDD. The date and time of the run is an identifier.  The following is an example of LREPI extract names.  
    LREPI 00/05 061500     
    LREPI 00/06 073100     
    LREPI 00/07 081500   
 
The LREPI extract entries assume all results are for the primary institution, and includes patient specific data with findings.  The LREPI extracts created are based on LREPI reporting criteria which is not available for generic reporting functionality.  
 This file will maintain up to 36 extract entries for each type of extract.  After 36 entries, when a new entry is added, the oldest entry is deleted from the file.  Sites are asked to run the LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN for months starting from 10/01/98
through 8/31/00. This will seed the Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) database with risk assessment data.  Subsequent updates to the EPI database will automatically occur monthly via the LREPI NIGHTLY TASK option. Sites will have up to 36 months of
extracts.  This may be fewer than 36 months if the site runs extracts for the same month more than once.  Multiple extracts for the same month occur when the site runs the LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN for a month to fix errors found by the receiving national
database.  For LREPI runs, the receiving national database is the Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) at the Austin  Automation Center (AAC).  
 
An LREPI entry in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file contains information that identifies the extract entry, the extract findings, and totals by finding item. The extract entry information includes the number, extract name, beginning and ending extract
dates, person who ran the extract option, task number, total patients evaluated and total patients with findings.  The extract findings include a number (for ease of selecting a finding item), patient, reminder term, value, alternate id, finding date,
related visit (if PCE data), encounter type (I/O), result, value, drug and DSUP (days supply).  These extract finding fields are returned by the reminder evaluation logic.  The result, value, and drug are all free text fields without specific input and
output transforms because the data comes from the source VistA data it came from, with read only access on this file.  The alternate id is specific to the LREPI extracts.  A number value in the alternate id field indicates that the finding is for 
Hepatitis C risk assessment.  The alternate id will be used for statistical purposes in the EPI database.     
 
The flow of LREPI processing is as follows: 1) LREPI gathers Lab Search/Extract patients and findings 2) LREPI gets all patients and findings from a reminder extract evaluation process given the extract date range and reminder list. (The reminder list is
from a new LREPI file 69.51).  2.1) The reminder extract evaluation logic uses medications mapped to reminder terms in the VA-NATIONAL EPI RX EXTRACT reminder, and the extract date range, to call new inpatient pharmacy and outpatient pharmacy extract
logic to get patient pharmacy findings.  2.2) The reminder extract evaluation uses the remaining reminder criteria to build a list of patients with findings from the following files in the extract period: 
  LAB DATA           (#63) 
  V POV              (#9000010.07) 
  V HEALTH FACTORS   (#9000010.23) 
  V PATIENT ED       (#9000010.16) 
  V EXAM             (#9000010.13) 2.3) The list of patients is used to evaluate the VA-HEP C RISK ASSESSMENT and VA-NATIONAL EPI LAB EXTRACT reminders.  The findings within the extract date range are added as Extract Findings in the REMINDER EXTRACT
SUMMARY file and then returned to the Lab Search/Extract process.  3) The Lab Search/Extract process uses the final list of patients and findings to create HL7 messages. Each reminder finding for a patient is used to create a DSP segment.  Pharmacy 
findings contain both a DSP and ZXE segment.  4) When the AAC processes the messages, error messages are returned for each message with the SSN related to the erroneous data. Note: Messages with errors are not added to the EPI database.  When erroneous
data is  fixed at the site, the LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN is run for the month with the error to transmit the entire month's data again.  The new data for each patient and finding date  replaces the old patient and finding date's data.  5) Two new options
are available on the REMINDER REPORTS menu that provide total counts by finding item, as well as a detailed list by finding item and SSN.  6) Sites are encouraged to provide FileMan read-only access to the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (810.3) for those 
who validate the extract data, the Hepatitis C implementation team, and Hepatitis C Coordinators responsible for monitoring Hepatitis C activities at each site.

              DESCRIPTION:      The NAME is the combination of a unique abbreviations for the type of extract.  The file contains different extract types:

                                Extracts of this type are prefixed LREPI. The following is an example of EPI lookup information:

                                time of the run is an identifier.

                                Extracts of this type are prefixed VA-IHD or VA-MH. The following is an example of IHD Look-up information:

                                The reporting period of the extract run is included in the extract name. Since a particular reporting period can be rerun, each entry for the same reporting period is assigned a sequential entry number: /01 represents the
                                first entry for the reporting period.

      - The pharmacy medications mapped to reminder terms are used to get
     inpatient orders and renewals and outpatient fills, refills, and partial
     fills.
      - The laboratory tests mapped to reminder terms are used to search the
     Lab results to identify target patients with data.

     This sort template sorts the reminder extract findings for an extract
     based on finding item and social security number.  The social security
     number is what the Austin Automation Center (AAC) returns in error
     messages if there are problems with the extract data. This report may be
     useful to help you find problem data based on the social security
     number in the AAC error messages.
