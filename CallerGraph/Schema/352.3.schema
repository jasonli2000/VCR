This file shall be used to flag clinic stop codes in the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file as either billable or non-billable for Means Test Billing and Third Party Billing.  It may also be used to flag billable stops so the Third Party auto biller will not
create bills for them.  The flagging of the stop codes is date-sensitive, so the ability to not bill can be turned on or off.  The default billing action is TO BILL ALL stop codes; thus, it is only necessary to add entries to this file if billing of a
particular clinic stop code is not desired.  
 
The routine IBEFUNC contains the function call to determine if a clinic stop code should not be billed on a specific date.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
