This file contains data elements as specified by the Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office for the Laboratory extract from existing DHCP files. Entries into this file are made by extracting data by two different methods depending upon whether or
not LMIP codes are used. Using LMIP codes, the data are extracted, in large part, from the WKLD LOG file (#64.03) which is populated by a routine provided by the Laboratory development team.  Not using LMIP codes, the data are derived from several Lab
files as well as from several other DHCP files. Once approved by the DSS site manager, entries in this file are loaded into an electronic mail message and sent to the commercial vendor. This file is intended to be used for validation purposes only.
Entries should be made only by the extract load routine.  
  
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.  However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference, the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT
NUMBER field (#2).  This cross reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be modified.  
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.
