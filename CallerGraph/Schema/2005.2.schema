 This file will contain an entry for every network storage location, as well as MUSE (EKG) network location(s). This file maps logical device names to physical device names, allowing continued operation even when network storage devices are done. The
Imaging site parameters has a number of fields pointing to this file to locate where on the network different files are written. Because the Imaging System operates in a distributed environment, an object may be stored on one or more of the network
storage devices.  These include multiple magnetic file servers, one or more optical jukeboxes, and possibly additional network devices accessed through a gateway.  
 
 Each logical location in the Network Location file is mapped to a physical device.  Every physical device on the network that will be used for objects must have at least one entry in the Network Location file.  
 
 The Operational Status field allows rapid software reconfiguration in the event of failure of one of the object storage devices.  
 
 Each network storage device has a type, such as magnetic or optical.  This allows "automatic file migration," where an object resides on a fast magnetic disk until 30 days since its last access, then it is moved to slower, less expensive optical media.  
 
 Three fields in the Image file (2005) are used to indicate the storage device(s) on which the object resides.  For example, an object may originally be captured to MAG1, the first magnetic server.  Within seconds, an abstract is created and stored on
this same device; the Disk & Vol, Abstract field will be set to MAG1 also.  Next, the Image file will be copied to the optical jukebox (if present on the network), creating an immediate backup copy.  The Disk & Vol, Optical field will now be set to point
to the optical device used for the optical copy.  
 
 The Network Location file was designed to allow access across a gateway.  This type of access has not been required at the test sites.  
 
 We recommend using names for magnetic devices that begin with the three letters, MAG, followed by sequential numbers.  We recommend that images be stored in directories named IMAGE at the first level.  Do not store any files in this directory that are
not objects handled by File 2005.  
 
 Logical names for Write Once Read Many (WORM) optical devices should start with the four letters, WORM.
