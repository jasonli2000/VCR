              DESCRIPTION:      Mild to moderate acute toxic reactions may occur at lithium drug concentrations from 1.5 - 2 mmol/L, and moderate to severe reactions at concentrations above 2 mmol/L. In patients with normal renal clearance the acute
                                toxic manifestations appear to occur in a fairly predictable sequence related to lithium concentrations. Thirst and polyuria may be followed by increased drowsiness, ataxia, tinnitus and blurred vision, indicating early
                                intoxication. As intoxication progresses the following manifestations may be encountered: confusion, increasing disorientation, muscle twitchings, hyperreflexia, nystagmus, seizures, diarrhea, vomiting, and eventually coma
                                and death.  Long term lithium use can also cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and a chronic tubulointersitial nephritis with progressive chronic kidney disease leading to ESRD.

              LAST EDITED:      APR 08, 2008 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate if the patient has been diagnosed with a systemic sepsis. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Definition Revised (2007): Sepsis is a vast clinical entity that takes a variety of forms. The spectrum of disorders spans from relatively mild physiologic abnormalities to septic shock. Please report the most significant
                                level using the criteria below: 
                                 
                                1. Sepsis: Sepsis is the systemic response to infection. Report this variable if the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS. SIRS is a widespread inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinical insults. This
                                syndrome is clinically recognized by the presence of two or more of the following: 
                                   - Temp >38 degrees C or <36 degrees C 
                                   - HR >90 bpm 
                                   - RR >20 breaths/min or PaCO2 <32 mmHg(<4.3 kPa) 
                                   - WBC >12,000 cell/mm3, <4000 cells/mm3, or >10% immature (band) 
                                     forms 
                                   - Anion gap acidosis: this is defined by either: 
                                      [Na + K] - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is 
                                      greater than 16, then an anion gap acidosis is present.  
                                     or 
                                      Na - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is greater 
                                      than 12, then an anion gap acidosis is present.  
                                 
                                 and one of the following: 
                                   - positive blood culture 
                                   - clinical documentation of purulence or positive culture from any 
                                     site thought to be causative 
                                 
                                2. Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock: Sepsis is considered severe when it is associated with organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Report this variable if the patient has the clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS or sepsis AND
                                documented organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Examples of organ dysfunction include: oliguria, acute alteration in mental status, acute respiratory distress. Examples of circulatory dysfunction include: hypotension,
                                requirement of inotropic or vasopressor agents.  
                                 
                                * For the patient that had sepsis preoperatively, worsening of any of the above signs postoperatively would be reported as a postoperative Examples: 
                                 
                                A patient comes into the emergency room with signs of sepsis - WBC 31, Temperature 104. CT shows an abdominal abscess. He is given antibiotics and is then taken emergently to the OR to drain the abscess. He receives
                                antibiotics intraoperatively. Postoperatively his WBC and Temperature are trending down.  
                                  POD#1 WBC 24, Temp 102 
                                  POD#2 WBC 14, Temp 100 
                                  POD#3 WBC 10, Temp 99 This patient does not have postoperative sepsis as his WBC and Temperature are improving each postoperative day.  
                                 
                                Patient comes into the ER with s/s of sepsis - WBC 31, Temp 104. CT shows an abdominal abscess. He is given antibiotics and is taken emergently to the OR to drain the abscess. He receives antibiotics intraoperatively.
                                Postoperatively his WBC and Temp are as follows: 
                                  POD#1 WBC 28, Temp 103 
                                  POD#2 WBC 24, Temp 102.6 
                                  POD#3 WBC 22, Temp 102 
                                  POD#4 WBC 21, Temp 101.6 
                                  POD#5 WBC 30, Temp 104 This patient does have postoperative sepsis because on postoperative day #5, his WBC and Temperature increase. The patient is having worsening of the defined signs of sepsis.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate if patient required New Mechanical Circulatory Support after transplant. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Definition Revised (2004): Indicate if the patient left the operating room suite with or required post-op placement of a new IABP, ECMO, or VAD for circulatory support within 30 days perioperatively. A "yes" response is
                                appropriate even if the pump is only used for a short time perioperatively. A "yes" response, however, is only correct if the patient did not enter the operating room with this same mechanical circulatory support, and the
                                device insertion occurred AFTER the induction of  anesthesia.  
                                 
                                If patient had/required new mechanical circulatory support, indicate whether the placement occurred intraoperatively or postoperatively.  Indicate the one appropriate response: 
                                 
                                - intraoperatively: occurring while patient was in the operating 
                                  room.  - postoperatively:  occurring after patient left the operating room.  
                                 
                                A "no" response is appropriate if the circulatory support device was placed as a prophylaxis before the induction of anesthesia; however, if it was placed for any reason after the induction of anesthesia, then a "yes"
                                response is appropriate. A "no" response is also appropriate if the primary operation is to insert a ventricular assist device.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the level of self care that summarizes the patient's status prior to surgery. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Definition Revised (2008): This is a question that focuses on the patient's abilities to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) in the 30 days prior to surgery.  Activities of daily living are defined as 'the activities
                                usually performed in the course of a normal day in a person's life'. ADLs include: bathing, feeding, dressing, toileting, and mobility. Report the corresponding level of self-care for activities of daily living 
                                demonstrated by this patient at the time the patient is being considered as a candidate for surgery (which should be no longer than 30 days prior to surgery). If the patient's status changes prior to surgery, that change
                                should be reflected in your assessment. For this time point, report the level of functional health status as defined by the following criteria.  
                                 
                                 (1) Independent: The patient does not require assistance from another 
                                     person for any activities of daily living. This includes a person 
                                     who is able to function independently with prosthetics, equipment, 
                                     or devices.  
                                 
                                 (2) Partially dependent: The patient requires some assistance from 
                                     another person for activities of daily living. This includes a 
                                     person who utilizes prosthetics, equipment, or devices but still 
                                     requires some assistance from another person for ADLs.  
                                 
                                 (3) Totally dependent: The patient requires total assistance for all 
                                     activities of daily living.  
                                 
                                 (4) Unknown: If unable to ascertain the functional status for the time 
                                     point of 'prior to the current illness' only, report as unknown.  
                                 
                                All patients with psychiatric illnesses should be evaluated for their ability to function with or without assistance with ADLs just as the non-psychiatric patient. For instance, if a patient with schizophrenia is able to
                                care for him/herself without the assistance of nursing care, he/she is considered independent.

                                     minutes ), which usually reflect dysfunction in a cerebral vascular 
                                     distribution.  
                                     These attacks may be recurrent and, at times, may precede a stroke.
