                                means that the income test was obtained at the VA Medical Center by a user using the appropriate Means Test (or other income test) software.

                                test is considered the primary income test for the patient for the income year.  If the field contains a 0, it means that the patient has another income test for the year which is considered the primary income test.

                                A pharmacy copay test and a means test may share the same income screening.  When one test becomes inactive (No Longer Required or No Longer Applicable), the status is saved in the Test Determined Status field so that it
                                may be reinstated again if the test becomes required. While one test is inactive, the veteran may have another test in effect - for example, if he does not require a means test, he may still be subject to the pharmacy
                                copayments and be eligible to take a pharmacy copayment exemption test.  If a pharmacy copyment test is created, it will utilize the same income screening as was in effect for the means test.  However, if the income
                                screening is then edited, and the veteran later becomes subject to being means tested, the old means test should not be automatically re-completed based on the old status - it needs to be re-completed and a new status
                                determined based on the changed income screening.  This cross-reference is meant to prevent the automatic re-completion of the old test in this situation.

                                to the Rx copay test away from the means test.  If a means test should ever become required again, the pointers from the income screening data can be found and re-pointed from this link.
