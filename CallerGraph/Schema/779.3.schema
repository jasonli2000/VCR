              HELP-PROMPT:      This is how long the Process Manager should wait between checks to see if another process of this type should be started.  Enter 0 to 9999. 
              DESCRIPTION:

              LAST EDITED:      NOV 15, 2004 
              HELP-PROMPT:      If the process cannot find work, how many seconds should it hang before looking again? 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is how long a process should wait between attempts to find work to do.

              HELP-PROMPT:      What function should this process call to do its work? Enter the optional entry point only in this field. 
              DESCRIPTION:

              DESCRIPTION:
                                How many times should the process look for work and then quit if it cannot find anything to do?  It'll hang between attempts the specified length of time.  


779.3,.13     PERSISTENT             0;13 SET

                                '0' FOR NO;

              HELP-PROMPT:      If this process is a listener, you must enter the name of an HL LOGICAL LINK that is a listener and whose TCP/IP PORT (OPTIMIZED) field contains the correct port number. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The primary use of this field is for TCP/IP listener processes, and indicates which port (via the HL Logical Link) that the process should be listening on.  However, it could be used to dedicate a client link process to a
                                particular link.

                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 23, 2004 
              HELP-PROMPT:      If this process is a listener, enter YES if it is a VMS TCP service rather than a Taskman process. 
              DESCRIPTION:      VMS services are not started or stopped via the HL7 Process Manager.  However, on a VMS system, these services are an important part of the HL7 system, and so an entry in the HL7 Process Registry should be created for 
                                them.  The Process Manager will use the PING functionality to verify that the listener is running.  


779.3,.16     BOX-VOLUME PAIR        0;16 POINTER TO TASKMAN SITE PARAMETERS FILE (#14.7)

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 24, 2010 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Select the node that this process should run on (optional). 
              DESCRIPTION:      The BOX-VOLUME PAIR field (#13) in the HLO SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#779.1) may be used to optionally specify the node that the HL7 (optimized) software should run on. 
                                 
                                The BOX-VLUME PAIR field (#16) of the HLO PROCESS REGISTRY file (#779.3) may be used to optionally specify the ndoe that a specify type of HL7 (optimized) software should execute on.  If this field has a value, it will
                                override the value in the HLO SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#779.1) for this type of HLO process.  
                                 
                                It is generally not necessary to designate which node an HLO process will execute on.  The primary exception may be to allow a Cache/NT site to utilize multiple listeners running on multiple nodes.  
                                 
                                Cache/VMS sites should not utilize listeners running under the HLO Process Manager. Instead, those sites should utilize the VMS TCPIP Services. If desired for load balancing, such a service may be run on multiple nodes.
                                The BOX-VOLUME PAIR  parameters do NOT affect listeners that utilize the VMS TCPIP Services.
