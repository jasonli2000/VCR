The entries in this table define the various FIFO queues that are part of the DICOM Gateway operation. For each queue, the entry defines how that queue is being used (incoming or outgoing messages, requests or responses, and relative priority).  
Currently, 16 queues are defined.  
 
For requests initiated by the remote DICOM application entity: 
 
 +-----+-----+-----------+----------+-----------+
 | Ltr | Chn | Direction | Type     | Priority  | 
 +-----+-----+-----------+----------+-----------+
 |  A  |  *  | INCOMING  | REQUEST  | HIGH      | 
 |  B  |  *  | OUTGOING  | RESPONSE | HIGH      | 
 |  C  |  *  | INCOMING  | REQUEST  | MEDIUM    |
