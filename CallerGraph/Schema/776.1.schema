              DESCRIPTION:
                                The values for this set of code field are ACTIVE and INACTIVE.  If set to ACTIVE the master job will queue background monitor jobs for the monitor.  If set to INACTIVE the master job will ignore the entry.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 0 and 9999999, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      Whenever the master job runs it checks every entry in this HL7 Monitor file (#776.1).  If an entry is active, a secondary check is made whether "it is time" to start a background job for the monitor.  If the active monitor
                                has never been run, a background job is started.  If the monitor has been run, then the next "time to run" is calculated by adding the number of minutes specified in this field to the time the monitor was last run.  If the
                                next "time to run" is now (or earlier), a background job for the monitor is started.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the M location for event startup in the format SUBROUTINE~ROUTINE.  (E.g., START~HLEVAPI.) 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Background tasks, started by the master job, are queued to the API specified in this field.  (The value of this field must be in the format of TAG~ROUTINE, which is converted to TAG^ROUTINE at run time.)

              HELP-PROMPT:      Must be an extrinsic function in the format of $$TAG^ROUTINE 
              DESCRIPTION:      Normally, the only test made by the master job to determine whether a monitor job should be started is STATUS (it must be ACTIVE) and the requeue minutes.  However, if this field is filled in with an extrinsic function
                                that returns a positive or null value, it can be used as an additional test.  
                                 
                                Let's say that the extrinsic fuction $$RUNOW^ROUTINE returns a 1 if a background job should be started, or null if not.  In this case, "$$RUNOW^ROUTINE" should be entered in this field.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field holds any additional technical notes deemed necessary by the monitor creator.  


776.1,50      EVENT DESCRIPTION      50;0   WORD-PROCESSING #776.101   (NOWRAP)

              DESCRIPTION:      This field should be used by the application developer to describe the monitor, and how it is used.  (If desired, the application developer may add additional, more technical notes in the TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION word 
                                processing field.) 


776.1,51      MAIL GROUPS            60;0 POINTER Multiple #776.106

              DESCRIPTION:      When a monitor runs, the M code can conditionally send a mail message to recipients.  This field, and other fields, are used to determine the recipients.  In addition, recipients can be added by M code immediately before
                                the sending of the message.  
                                 
                                The fields used to determine mail message recipients are: 
                                 
                                * MAIL GROUPS (#60) - pointer to the Mail Group file (#3.8.) * RECIPIENTS (#61) - pointer to the New Person file (#200.) * REMOTES (#62) - free-text remote recipient addresses.  
                                 
                                And, remember that additional recipients can be added (by populating the XMY array) on-the-fly at the time the message is sent.  
                                 
                                Please refer to the documentation included with patch HL*1.6*106 for additional explanation.
