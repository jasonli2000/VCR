This file stores all information specific to each individual Request Queue. It defines how the entries in each queue will be processed, how often the processed entries in the queue will be purged, etc.  
 
This file also stores all Requests and Request-specific data for this queue, i.e. the parameters passed in by the calling program as well as the information generated while the VDEF Request Processor program is handling this request.

              DESCRIPTION:      Current status of this VDEF REquest Processor Queue. Turning the Queue off will result in VDEF HL7 message generation for the Queue being suspended until such time when the Queue is turned back on. NOTE: Turning off a
                                Request Queue will not prevent VDEF from adding requests to it. Turning a VDEF Request Queue off for a prolonged period of time may result in a significant number of VDEF Requests accumulating in that Queue and causing
                                disk space problems. If VDEF messaging is to be completely turned off for a Request Queue, the associated VDEF Requestor should be turned off via menu option VDEF (De)Activate Requestor.
