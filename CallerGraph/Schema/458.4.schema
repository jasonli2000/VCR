This file contains extended absence records for part-time physicians that work adjustable hours and have a memorandum of service level expectations.  Such employees must maintain an electronic subsidiary record (ESR) that records their actual work.  
 
The part-time physician can enter an extended absence record to indicate a future period when they will not be performing work for the VA.  The software will automatically change the status of ESR days with a scheduled tour of duty to signed if those
days are covered by the period of extended absence.  Therefore the physician will not need to manually update their ESR during the absence.
