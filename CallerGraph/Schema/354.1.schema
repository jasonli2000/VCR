DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.  
 
Under normal operation it is not necessary to edit the fields in this file directly.  The option Manually Change Copay Exemption (Hardships) can be used to update and correct entries by creating a new exemption.  If many patient records have problems the
option Print/Verify Patient Exemption Status can be used to correct the entries.  
 
This file will hold the time sensitive data that is used to determine if a patient can be exluded from any type of billing for a period of time.  The initial use of this file is for storing the time sensitive data related to whether or not a patient is
exempt from pharmacy copay requirement due to income below the pension level.  
 
The file then maintains the audit trail of changes to exemptions and historical data about exemptions.  The data in this file should be retained for approximately the current calendar year and the past calendar year.  The ability to purge data in this
file will be added at a future time.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

                                If this exemption requires retroactively canceling prior charges, this is the beginning date for the retroactive cancellation.  This must be tracked to prevent duplicate retroactive cancellations of the same charges.

                                This cross-reference is set whenever bills are retroactively canceled due to the medication copayment exemption patch.  It is used to prevent canceling charges in AR for the same period.  This is necessary because the
                                direct link between IB and AR is not maintained for this functionality as it is necessary to remove admin and interest charges that may have accumulated.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field will contain the date of the threshold used to calculate exemptions based on income only if the date of the threshold was over 1 year in the past.  This will be used by the add threshold option to list and
                                recompute these exemptions when new thresholds are entered.

                                This is a cross reference of all active exemptions created with prior year thresholds.  It will be used when entering new thresholds to identfy patient exemptions in need of updating.  It will be deleted by the IB

                                is encountered after a letter has already been printed (based on this exemption) another letter will not be printed.
