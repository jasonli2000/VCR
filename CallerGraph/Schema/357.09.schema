              LAST EDITED:      DEC 08, 1995 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter whether you want the background purge option to purge all records from form tracking older that the number of days specified in the field FORM TRACKING RETENTION DAYS, or completed records, or no records.  
                                 
                                After purging records from form tracking, the purge utility will check to see if all forms for inactive form definitions have been received.  If so, then the form definition and Form Specification for that form may be
                                deleted.  Purging ALL Form Tracking entries will cause the form definition and form specification to be deleted for forms that have not yet been completed.  Once the form definition is deleted the form specification can
                                not be recreated in DHCP, if it does not exist on the AICS workstation the form can not be recognized.  This is generally not a problem as entries must be at least 60 days old to purge.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the form to be used as the default form for doing data entry when no form exists for a clinic. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the form definition that will be used during manual data entry if no form for a clinic is defined.  If this is not filled in then the PRIMARY CARE SAMPLE (2.1) form in the tool kit will be used as the default form. 
                                If that form has been deleted then provider, procedure     and diagnosis will be asked but no quick entry features will be available.

              HELP-PROMPT:      If you would like to suppress printing of encounter forms for inpatients enter 'No'.  Answering 'Yes' or leaving blank will cause Encounter Forms for inpatients to print. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter 'Yes' if you want encounter forms printed for Inpatients or 'No' if no enounter forms for inpatients should be printed.  If this field is null, it will be treated as a 'Yes' and encounter forms for inpatients will be
                                printed.  
                                 
                                This parameter affects all options that print forms for appointments for a clinic, it does not affect printing individual forms.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:

              LAST EDITED:      APR 03, 1996 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'Yes' if you want to be able to make a follow up appointment using the AICS manual Data entry option. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Enter 'Yes' if you wish for users at your site to be able to make a follow up appointment during data entry of an encounter form or enter 'No' if you do not wish to see that prompt.

              HELP-PROMPT:      How should data captured in the AICS EF Data entry option be passed to PCE? 
              DESCRIPTION:      Choose how data captured in the AICS EF Data Entry Options should be passed to PCE.  The data entry options use the same mechanism to update PCE (and scheduling) as the scanning software.  Background refers to sending data
                                to PCE by using TaskMan to create a separate process so the user may continue working.  Foreground refers to sending the data to PCE in real time.  The choices for data entry are: 
                                   
                                   Background - This is the fastest method for the user.  No validation 
                                       of the data is done by PCE and no display there is no display of 
                                       results.  
                                 
                                   Background with Validation -  This is the next fastest way.  The data 
                                       is validated with PCE prior to passing in the background.  If the 
                                       data does not validate, the user will be shown the error messages 
                                       and allowed to re-edit the data.  
                                 
                                   Foreground with no display of data - Data is always validated when 
                                       passed to PCE in the foreground. If the data does not validate, 
                                       the user will be shown the error messages and allowed to re-edit 
                                       the data.  
                                 
                                  Foreground with display - This is the slowest method but will be most 
                                      useful as a validation tool.  The data sent to PCE is redisplayed 
                                      after it has been been accepted by PCE.  Any differences in what 
                                      was supposed to be sent and what was actually sent should be noticable.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 0 and 99, 0 Decimal Digits.  This is the amount of fill required for Paper Keyboard to recognize the Bubble as checked. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter a number between 0 and 99 that represents the percentage of fill required for a bubble to be considered as checked.  Entering a zero will leave the determination up to Paper Keyboard.  If this field is left blank
                                AICS will use 20% as the amount of fill required.  
                                 
                                This field corresponds to the Threshold % field in the Metric dialog box in Paper Keyboard.  Modifying this field will only affect new forms.  Existing form specification files will not be affected.  To modify an existing
                                form specification file it must be deleted from the workstation and the corresponding entry in file 359.2 must be deleted.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 21, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 0 and 99, 0 Decimal Digits.  This is the amount of background allowable that Paper Keyboard will ignore. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter a number between 0 and 99 that represents the percentage of background fill in a bubble that can exist before Paper Keyboard will consider any markings in the bubble.  If this field is left blank then AICS will use
                                5%.  Entering a zero leaves the determination up to Paper Keyboard.  
                                 
                                This field corresponds to the Background % field in the Metric dialog box.  Entering a small value prevents small dots on the page from appearing as check marks.  The value of this field should always be less than the
                                value for the FILL % FOR BUBBLES field.  
                                 
                                Editing this field will not affect any current form specification files, only files created after changing this value.  To modify a current form specification you must delete the file from the workstation and remove the 
                                corresponding entry from file 359.2.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 0 and 999, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      If you have chosen to print a 1010F with your encounter forms, this is the number of days between the expiration of a means test and the appointment date before that you want to print 1010F's for.  For example, if this
                                field is set to 30, then 1010F's will print for means tests that are due to expire within 30 days of the appointment.  1010F's will also print if they are in a required status.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                This parameter is used in PRMT^IBDFN2 if a 1010F is printed from the print manager.

              LAST EDITED:      OCT 07, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 0 and 999, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter the number of days that entries in Form Tracking will be retained in a Pending Pages status.  The automatic encounter form job will check this value each night and attempt to pass forms in this status to PCE after
                                they have been in this status for the specified number of days past the encounter date.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>8)!(X<0)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      NOV 20, 1998 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Entering a number greater than zero will reduce the recognition area of hand print fields by .1mm on all sides.  Type a Number between 0 and 8. 
              DESCRIPTION:      When scanning, some sites have problems with the outline of hand print fields not being removed completely.  This results in "phantom" entries being detected by Paper Keyboard and user validation during recognition.  
                                 
                                This problem is caused by the interaction of 3 different features, the darkness of the print, the size of the recognition area, and the light intensity of the scanner.  This field allows you to reduce the size of the
                                recognition area which may assist in moving the "phantom" outside of the recognition area.  This information is then computed and stored in the FormSpec file on the VistA server and the workstation.  
                                 
                                To leave the recognition area the same size as before AICS v3.0 patch IBD*3*25 enter a zero.  The default value of the field if there is no entry is 5.  The maximum value of the field is 8.  Reducing the size will move all
                                4 sides of the box in by .1mm times the number entered.  
                                 
                                If you are having the "phantom" problem, you should also check the value in fields DARKNESS OF DOTS and CLOSENESS OF DOTS in this file.  These fields allow for printing the hand print field outlines at a lighter value.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                The value of this field is used in routine IBDFBKS2 to reduce the xy coordinates that are computed as the recognition area in the Paper Keyboard form spec file.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Entering a number of less than 12 will reduce the size of dots that print on Encounter Forms.  Type a Number between 9 and 15, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      When scanning, some sites have problems with the outline of hand print fields not being removed completely.  This results in "phantom" entries being detected by Paper Keyboard and user validation during recognition.  
                                 
                                This problem is caused by the interaction of 3 different features, the   darkness of the print, the size of the recognition area, and the light intensity of the scanner.  This field allows sites to determine the Pen Width
                                value of the dots of handprint fields and bubbles when printing on laser printers.  Reducing the pen width below 12 will make the dots smaller thus making it more likely for the dots to disappear during the scanning
                                process.  
                                 
                                To leave the dot size the same as before AICS v3.0 patch IBD*3*25 enter a 12.  The default value of the field if there is no entry is 12.  The minimum value of this field is 9, the maximum value is 15.  Changing this value
                                immediately affects the printing of encounter forms.  Test changes by changing the value one number at a time and then viewing the form.  
                                 
                                If you are having the "phantom" problem, you should also check the values in fields CLOSENESS OF DOTS and REDUCE HANDPRINT RECOGNITION SIZE in this file.  These fields allow for printing the hand print field outlines at a
                                lighter value and reduce the size of the area used for recognition.

              HELP-PROMPT:       Type a Number between 20 and 30, 0 Decimal Digits.  The default value is 25.  A number lower than 25 will reduce "Phantom" data found during scanning. 
              DESCRIPTION:      When scanning, some sites have problems with the outline of hand print fields not being removed completely.  This results in "phantom" entries being detected by Paper Keyboard and user validation during recognition.  
                                 
                                This problem is caused by the interaction of 3 different features, the   darkness of the print, the size of the recognition area, and the light intensity of the scanner.  This field allows sites to determine the percentage
                                of fill (closeness of dots) that is used to print handprint field outlines and bubbles when using a laser printer.  
                                 
                                To leave the closeness of dots the same as before AICS v3.0 patch IBD*3*25 enter a 25.  The default value of the field if there is no entry is 25.  The minimum value of this field is 20, the maximum value is 30.  Changing
                                this value immediately affects the printing of encounter forms.  Reducing the closeness of dots below 25 will allow Paper Keyboard to more easily remove the dots.  Test changes by changing the value one number at a time
                                and then viewing the form.  
                                 
                                If you are having the "phantom" problem, you should also check the values in fields DARKNESS OF DOTS and REDUCE HANDPRINT RECOGNITION SIZE in this file.  These fields allow for printing of the hand print field outlines at
                                a lighter value and improve recognition during scanning.

              DESCRIPTION:      If checkout date/time is not present on the Encounter Form, the software will automatically default a checkout date/time to that of the scan date/ time.  If you do not wish to default the checkout date/time, you should 
                                enter 'YES' in this field to stop the automatic default.
