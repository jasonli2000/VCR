This file contains the modifiers that can be associated with an imaging exam.  These modifiers are used to further describe the procedure associated with the exam. For example, if an exam of the 'hand' was performed then the modifier 'left' can be chosen
to indicate which hand.  
 
If an exam has a modifier associated with it, then it will automatically appear on the report.  
 
When the system is installed, the following modifiers are loaded as part of the module: 
 
         o PORTABLE 
         o OPERATING ROOM 
         o BILATERAL 
         o LEFT 
         o RIGHT 
 
Portable, Operating Room and Bilateral are very important for the compilation of the AMIS report.  For this reason, the name of the modifier is uneditable.  Any modifier who meaning is portable, operating room, or bilateral should be further defined by
entering one of these choices in the AMIS Credit Indicator field. Series type procedures cannot be assigned modifiers that affect AMIS credit.  
 
Entries in this file should not be deleted. Adding new entries is always allowed.  
 
Each modifier must be assigned one or more Imaging Type(s) in order to appear as a selection during modifier edits of procedures and exams. To deactivate a modifier, use the option for editing procedure modifiers to delete all the imaging types that
appear under the modifier.  
 
To add site specific modifiers and to obtain more information regarding this file, see the ADPAC Guide.  
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
 The data for the 'PROCEDURE MODIFIERS' file is stored in the ^RAMIS(71.2, global. At the present time this file is very static after initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.  It should also be translated if the operating
system supports this function.
