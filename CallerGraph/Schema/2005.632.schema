              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a number between 0 and 99999, 9 decimal digits. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is Computed Tomography Dose Index volume. It is approximately the average dose that would have been delivered to a standard cylindrical plastic phantom for a specific examination. One phantom is used for head
                                scans and another larger diameter phantom is used for body scans. The CTDIvol must be adjusted for body size and other factors to estimate the dose to the scanned volume of each actual patient. However, the CTDIvol is very
                                useful for comparing and adjusting CT imaging protocols. Unit: mGy (milligray).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a number between 0 and 99999, 8 decimal digits. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is the Dose Length Product. The Dose Length Product is the CTDIvol multiplied by the scan length (slice thickness × number of slices) in centimeters. Unit: mGy-cm (milligray-centimeters)

              HELP-PROMPT:      Select the phantom type. 
              DESCRIPTION:        This field indicates which phantom type was used to determine the 
                                  irradiation dosage of this irradiation dosage instance.  A phantom 
                                  is a specially designed object that is scanned or imaged in the field 
                                  of medical imaging to evaluate, analyze, and tune the performance of 
                                  various imaging devices.
