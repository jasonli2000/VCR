This log file contains entries that track the execution of the appointment status update process.  An entry is added/modified for each date that has been processed.  The SDAM BACKGROUND JOB and the SDAM APPT UPDATE options create the entries.  
 
The following fields are entered at the beginning of the update process: 
                o  APPOINTMENT DATE 
                o  UPDATE METHOD (background or manual) 
                o  DATE LAST UPDATE STARTED 
                o  USER 
 
The date and time the update process completed is logged at the finish of the update process in the DATE LAST UPDATE COMPLETED field.  If this field is missing at the time of OPC generation, the user will be warned that the update process has not
completed. OPC generation can continue, however.  
 
At the end of the OPC generation process, the OPC GENERATED DATE field will be logged only if the DATE LAST UPDATE COMPLETED is present.  If the OPC GENERATED DATE field is not present then OPC transmission will not be allowed for the appointment date.
