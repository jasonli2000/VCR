59.7,47       SCRIPTALK PRINT DEVICE MAPPING 47;0 POINTER Multiple #59.747 (Add New Entry without Asking)

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This multiple adds the capability to tie a ScripTalk printer to regular Pharmacy label printer(s) to control where the ScripTalk labels print for multi-divisions.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Multiple print devices may be mapped to a ScripTalk printer.  If no data is defined in this multiple, the ScripTalk printer tied to the division will be used.  
                                 
                                The use of this multiple builds upon existing ScripTalk functionality, so a divisional ScripTalk device must be defined for the mapped device functionality to work properly and to have a default device defined.
