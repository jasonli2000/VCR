              LAST EDITED:      AUG 22, 2003 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field holds the internal entry number of the monitor entry in the HL Event Monitor file (#776.1).  

              CROSS-REFERENCE:  776^M 
                                1)= S ^HLEV(776,"M",$E(X,1,30),DA)=""
                                2)= K ^HLEV(776,"M",$E(X,1,30),DA)
                                With each Monitor Master Job run, the master job checks every monitor entry in the HL Event Monitor file (#776.1).  If it is "time" for the monitor to be queued, a background job is queued to run that monitor.  At the time
                                of queueing an entry is created in this file holding (among other values) the internal entry number of the monitor entry in file 776.1.  The IEN is stored in the Monitor field (#3), and this M cross-reference holds the IEN
                                of the monitor.  
                                 
                                Note: The Monitor field does not point to the monitor, strictly speaking, 
                                      because this field is a free-text field.  However, since it holds 
                                      the IEN, it is a "functional pointer" to the monitor file.  
                                      (The field was created this way to enable monitors to be deleted 
                                      at will without worry about dangling pointers.)

              LAST EDITED:      MAY 23, 2003 
              DESCRIPTION:      The master job checks all monitors, and where appropriate queues background jobs for each monitor.  These background jobs are linked to this file, and to entries in this file.  This field holds the master job internal
                                entry number in the HL7 Monitor Master Job file (#776.2).

              DESCRIPTION:
                                Normally, a background monitor job is queued to run now.  However, at times a monitor job is queued to a future time.  When this occurs, the future queue time is stored in this field.
