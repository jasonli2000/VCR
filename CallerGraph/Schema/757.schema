This file is a map of Major Concepts within the Lexicon Utility and contained in the expression file (#757.01).  While the primary purpose of this file is for file maintenance, it also supports various other functions such as the display of
classification codes by linking concepts to codes and the ability to filter out unwanted search responses by linking concepts to semantic classes and types.
