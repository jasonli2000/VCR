              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 9-11 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter the applicants social security number as nine digits, i.e., 123456789.  If the social security number is unknown and you need to assign a pseudo SSN follow it with a 'P', i.e., 123456789P.  Simply enter a 'P' if you
                                wish the system to determine the proper pseudo SSN. Pseudo SSN's are determined as follows: 
                                   
                                   1.  Based on the following table assign the first three numbers 
                                       of the pseudo SSN based on the patient's three initials in 
                                       first-middle-last initial order.  For example, if the name 
                                       is 'SMITH,JOHN P' the table would be used to convert JPS 
                                       (the initials for JOHN P SMITH) into 467.

                                       in month-day-year order.  Where a month, day or year consists of 
                                       less than one numeric, i.e., JUNE=6, preceed it by a zero, i.e., 
                                       JUNE=06.  If the month and/or year of birth are unknown indicate 
                                       them as '00'.
