This file controls the orderly sequence of lab test ordering.  All ordering information is stored in the ^LRO global.  This file is pointed to by many other files, and supplies information for order entry and order status output.  No editing of the
entries should take place, as it may cause corruption or loss of ordering information. The file contains print and sort templates that are used by a variety of lab routines and options to format reports.

  APP (#651)    RECORD    MUMPS    IR    ACTION    WHOLE FILE (#69)
      Short Descr:  Index is used to send AMA/Billable panels to PCE.
      Description:  The "APP" index is used by routine LRBEBA5 to send Lab data to PCE.  EN^LRBEBA5 is called from routine LRNIGHT, the nightly cleanup task.  If the current date is the same as the date stored in PANEL PROCESS DATE field (#620) of the
                    LABORATORY SITE file (#69.9), then routine LRBEBA5 uses index "APP" to locate data for AMA/Billable panels that have not been sent to PCE due to pending results for atomic tests on the panel.  Panel tests from the previous calendar
                    month will be "unbundled" and the CPT Codes for the verified atomic tests are sent to PCE.
