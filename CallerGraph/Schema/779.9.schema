The Health Leven Seven (Optimized) software (HLO) was released as patch HL*1.6*126 to the HL7 v1.6 software package.  Although it is structurally and functionally an independent system, it is officially part of HL7 1.6.  This is a messaging system
similar to the old HL7 1.6 package, but it was designed from the ground up and is more robust, more capable, and supports a much higher message throughput.  
 
This file contains the priorities of HLO queues as assigned by the system operations staff. 
 
It is not necessary to assign a priority to a queue.  However, doing so will change the frequency that HLO services the queue.  Important queues that tend to be backed up should be assigned a higher priority.  Less important queues may be assigned a
lower priority.  The goal of setting queue priorities is to balance the HLO resources over the queues in order to obtain a desired performance.  
 
Currently priorities may be set only for outgoing queues, though the file was designed to also support the assignment of priorities for incomming queues.  The option for entering the type of queue (incomming or outgoing) currently will automatically
default to outgoing. A future enhancment may support the ability to assign priorities to incomming queues.  
 
To set the priority the name of the queue must be specified.  As explained, currently the queue will be assumed to be outgoing. Optionally,if the priority is to be set only for a specific link then the link must be specified.  
 
Examples: 
 
You could set the priority of an outgoing queue named "HLO OUT" without specifying the link.  The effect would be to set the priority of all outgoing queues named "HLO OUT" regardless of the link.  
 
You could set the priority of an outgoing queue named "HLO OUT" and also specify the link.  The effect would be to set the priority of the outgoing queue named "HLO OUT" that is sending messages via that specific link only.  
 
If a queue's priority is specified to apply to all links, but that queue's priority is also specified for a specific link, that specific priority setting will override the general one.

              HELP-PROMPT:      What direction is the queue's messages? 
              DESCRIPTION:      HLO includes queues that contain incoming messages and other queues that contain outgoing messages.  For example, there may be two queues named 'MPI ADT~A08', with one for messages being transmitted to another system, and 
                                the other queue of the same name for messages that were received from other systems.  
                                 
                                At present this field will automatically default to OUTGOING.  A future enhancment may support the assignment of priorties for incomming queues.

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 01, 2010 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer YES if this priority applies to all links for this queue. A YES does not preclude entering a different priority for a specific queue. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter YES if the priority should be applied to all queues of the given name, regardless of the link the queue is for.  
                                 
                                It is allowed that even if set to YES, a different priority can be assigned to that queue for specific links, and that priority for the queue/link will override the more general one.  
                                 
                                If this field is set to NO, that means that the PRIORITY field (#.04) is ignored.  A priority can still be assigned to a specific queue by specifying the specific link, along with the priority for that queue/link. 
                                 
                                If it is set to NO or left blank then the queue would assume the default priority of 50, unless overridden in the LINKS multiple.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a whole number between 20 and 100.  Queues given a higher priority will be serviced more often.  The default priority is 50. 
              DESCRIPTION:      A priority is an integer between 20 and 100, with a default value of 50.  The lower the priority, the less frequently the queue will be serviced.  Conversely, the higher a queue's priority the more frequently it will be 
                                serviced.  The recommended use of the priority functionality is to reserve its use to the operations staff. A queue's priority should be increased if experience shows that it tends to get backed up.
