This is the local registry file for SCD.  It contains the main data for a SCD patient.  Once a patient is entered in this file, the patient can not be removed.  This file points to the patient file because a patient must exist in the patient file in
order for an entry to be made in this file.  The IEN for a patient in this file will be the same as the IEN in the patient file because the pointer number is used as the IEN in the this file.
