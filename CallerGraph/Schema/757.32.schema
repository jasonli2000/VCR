              DESCRIPTION:      This field stores the VUID for a specific mapping. The VUID for a given mapping will be assigned by terminologists using the Standards & Terminology Services team's technologies. One use for this field will be to identify
                                which mapping is being deployed by the terminology server's deployment processes.
