ELEMENT       TITLE                 LOCATION      TYPE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file contains the print formats for the following types of imaging output: 
 
          o flash cards 
          o exam labels 
          o jacket labels 
          o report headers 
          o report footers 
 
The entries are all site specific.  No entries are loaded when the module is initialized.  Each format can contain any of the fields from the 'LABEL PRINT FIELDS' file.  
 
Also, if the same print field is desired more than once on the same 'format', then enclose the print field name in double quotes (").  For example, if two FREE TEXT fields are needed on a report header, then at the 'Select PRINT FIELDS:' prompt enter
"FREE TEXT".  
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
The data for the 'LBL/HDR/FTR FORMATS' file is stored in the ^RA(78.2, global. At the present time this file is very static after day-one initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.  It should also be translated if the operating
system supports this function.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the name associated with this format. Format names are assigned by each site and must be 3 to 30 non-numeric characters in length.  
                                 
                                Following are the potential uses of the formats you are defining: 
                                        1) Flash cards 
                                        2) Jacket labels

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the number of rows in this format, between 1 and 66. This number does not correspond to the line where the format should begin printing! 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the number of rows desired in this format. The total number of rows allowed is limited to 66.  
                                 
                                The amount of rows may be set greater than the actual amount of lines necessary for the printing of the format.  
                                 
                                For example, if it is desired to have a blank line at the beginning, the first print field can be set to start at row 2 to produce the blank line at the beginning.  Also, blank lines may be added at the end by having the 
                                total number of rows greater than the line number where the last print field actually prints.
