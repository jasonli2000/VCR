                  TECHNICAL DESCR:  Values stored in the REJECT CODE field are normally expected to have a matching entry in the FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE (#161.99) file.  The FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE file contains a list of reject codes and 
                                    their descriptions.  
                                     
                                    However it is possible that a new reject code will be transmitted to VistA by Central Fee and stored in the REJECT CODE field before the FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE file is updated with that new code.  In this case 
                                    outputs that display the description of a code will display text similar to "Reject reason code not currently defined in list."
