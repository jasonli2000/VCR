This file contains default PM (preventive maintenance) parameters for device types. The intent is to give facilities a means of scheduling PM inspections for a given device type (defibrillator, transformer, electrical generator, etc) without having to
explicitly edit the record of each individual piece of equipment. If the PM parameters in the EQUIPMENT file (File 6914) do not agree with the corresponding PM parameters in this file, the information in the EQUIPMENT file will take precedence.

                LAST EDITED:      FEB 12, 1988 
                DESCRIPTION:       STARTING MONTH is used by the PM module as a criterion in determining when a PM is due. Let's consider the following example: an item subject to MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, and ANNUAL PM inspections. If STARTING MONTH were set
                                  to FEB; an ANNUAL inspection would be scheduled in FEB; QUARTERLY inspections in MAY, AUG, and NOV; and MONTHLY inspections in MAR, APR, JUN, JUL, SEP, OCT, DEC, and JAN.  
                                   If STARTING MONTH is left blank, JAN will be assumed.

                HELP-PROMPT:      ANSWER MUST BE 7 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH 
                DESCRIPTION:       A range of months (inclusive) during which PMI's are to be suspended. For example, an entry of 'NOV-MAR' for an air-conditioner would suppress the scheduling of any PMI's in NOV, DEC, JAN, FEB, and MAR.  
                                   Some care needs to be taken when using this field. If you want an annual inspection, for instance, be sure that the STARTING MONTH is not within the range specified by the SKIP MONTHS; otherwise the ANNUAL PMI will
                                  never be scheduled.  
                                   Entries must take the form 'MMM-NNN', where MMM is a three character abbreviation of the first month for which PMI's should be suspended and NNN is a three character abbreviation of the last month for which PMI's should 
                                  be suspended. Valid abbreviations are: JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, and DEC.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 99, 0 Decimal Digits 
                DESCRIPTION:      An index of the importance of performing PMI's on this device. Enter an integer between 1 and some upper limit not greater than 99 (most sites use 10 or 20). The closer a value is to the upper limit, the more critical
                                  the Preventive Maintenance Inspections are. A value of 1 indicates that PMI's are desireable but far from essential (least critical).  
                                   
                                  When PM worklists are generated, the system will ask if all devices should be included or just those whose CRITICALITY is within a certain user specified range (say, 7 to 10). This is intended as a means of adjusting
                                  workload to match available resources.  
                                   
                                  When a CRITICALITY range is specified (as part of PM worklist generation), the system will ask the user whether equipment with no value for CRITICALITY should be included or excluded.

                  LAST EDITED:      JAN 09, 1997 
                  DESCRIPTION:       Make a separate entry for each category (MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, etc.) of PMI that is to be scheduled for this device. The PM module looks at this field in conjunction with the STARTING MONTH when PM lists are generated.  
                                     Let's consider a fairly complex example: a device with SEMI-ANNUAL, QUARTERLY, and MONTHLY PMI's and a STARTING MONTH of MAR. Assuming no entry for SKIP MONTHS, the following PMI's will be scheduled: 
                                      SEMI-ANNUAL in MAR and SEP; 
                                      QUARTERLY in JUN and DEC;

                  DESCRIPTION:       Each scheduled PMI may be composed of some combination of the following discrete levels of activity: 
                                       Level 1 - Visual inspection only; 
                                       Level 2 - Check and adjust operator controls; 
                                       Level 3 - Electrical safety analysis; 
                                       Level 4 - Minor parts replacement;

                                     LEVEL is an optional field, and is intended to accommodate the needs of certain facilities with highly developed PM programs. Entries for LEVEL (if any) will appear on the PM worklist as a reminder to the responsible
