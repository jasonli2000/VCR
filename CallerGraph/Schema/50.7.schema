              DESCRIPTION:      The text in this field shall be presented as a default for the Patient Instructions prompt in the Outpatient Pharmacy package when entering orders, if the Dispense Drug selected is matched to this Pharmacy Orderable Item.
                                This text will also be presented during the Outpatient Medication order entry process through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and the CPRS user can then determine whether or not these Instructions should be part
                                of the order. For all words entered in this field, the software will check for expansions for each word in the Medication Instruction (#51) file, and expand the word accordingly.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates whether the Orderable Item is marked as Non-VA Med or not. It is controlled by software and is not manually editable. An Orderable Item will only be marked as Non-VA Med if there is at least one active

              HELP-PROMPT:      Select an immunization file entry to associate with this orderable item. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is added as part of the "Immunizations Documentation by BCMA" project.  A mapping relationship is created between the file entry (Pharmacy Orderable Item) and the pointed-to immunization so that a record can be
                                created in PCE's V IMMUNIZATION file corresponding to the BCMA administration of an immunization.

                                This cross reference permits lookup of all PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS that are mapped to a given IMMUNIZATION.  It will be used by the file standardization process to identify entries that may require re-mapping if an
                                immunization entry is later inactivated.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES to use the med routes from the Dosage Form file associated to the orderable item or NO to use the possible med routes associated to the orderable item. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This flag governs the source of the medication routes that will be used during medication order entry. If this field is set to YES, the optional list of med routes will be derived from the Dosage Form file associated to
                                the orderable item. Otherwise, it will be derived from the Possible Med Routes Sub-file associated to the orderable item.

                                A "YES" indicates the med routes from the Dosage Form (#50.606) will be used for the Orderable item. A "NO" indicates the med routes from the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES sub-file #50.711 will be used.

              DESCRIPTION:      If the DEFAULT MED ROUTE field (#.06) is populated then that value will be returned as the default value. If the DEFAULT MED ROUTE field (#.06) is not populated and the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple is populated with a
                                single entry and the USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) is set to "NO", the single entry will be returned as the default value.

                                otherwise from the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple.
