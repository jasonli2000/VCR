              DESCRIPTION:      The title is the full title of a specific serial publication.  Such titles can be extremely long and the initial words in two different titles can be exactly the same for a considerable length, for example: SCANDINAVIAN
                                JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE. SUPPLEMENTUM Note: Since exact alphabetization of these titles is very important in the serials process, it is crucial
                                that the field length be long enough to accommodate all possibilities.
