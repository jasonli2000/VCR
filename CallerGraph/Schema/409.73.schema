This file will contain the current transmission status of all Outpatient Encounters and Deleted Outpatient Encounters that have been transmitted or require transmission to the National Patient Care Database.  
 
Entries in this file are only created when an existing entry for the specified encounter does not exist.  When an Outpatient Encounter is deleted, the entry in this file that pointed to that Outpatient Encounter is modified so that it points to the
Deleted Outpatient Encounter that was created.  
 
This file does not contain the transmission history for an encounter.
