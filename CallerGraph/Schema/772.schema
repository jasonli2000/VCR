                                GENACK^HLMA, or DIRECT^HLMA.  When they do, they will pass by reference into the last OPTIONS (in the documentation) parameter the value of the namespace.  The value of the namespace will be in the form of 
                                OPTIONS("NAMESPACE")=NAMESPACE.  
                                 
                                Please note that the calls to the three APIs mentioned above use the variable HLP to hold the passed in by reference array.  So, in the HLMA code (and other code invoked by HLMA), the actual variable used is 
                                HLP("NAMESPACE").
