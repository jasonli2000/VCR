The PERIOD OF SERVICE file contains 37 entries as determined by VACO MAS.  Alteration of existing entries or addition of new ones will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the efficient operation of the MAS module and other modules.  Updates to this
file will be provided by the MAS developers by way of regular releases.

              LAST EDITED:      NOV 25, 1986 
              DESCRIPTION:      If this period of service has been inactivated and should no longer be selectable, this field should contain YES.  Periods of service are maintained by VACO and the MAS software module.  Therefore, this information should
                                not be altered by the site.  Should it be necessary to inactivate a period of service, this will occur through the release of the MAS module via a regular software release.
