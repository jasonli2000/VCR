              DESCRIPTION:      If an AR Group can be defined multiple times, then this field would be set to Yes.  An example of a Group that would be defined multiple times is the Billing Agency since a site may have more than one billing agency. 
                                However, other groups such as the place the site sends Bank Deposits should not be defined more than once.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the VA FileMan input template that is used to edit this AR group.  Since fields within this file are either shared or specific to a particular type of group, it is necessary to define input templates that control
                                which fields are asked of the user.
