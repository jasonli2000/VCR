              HELP-PROMPT:      ANSWER MUST BE 1-4 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH.  The group category is defined by each Inventory Point to group like items for printing the catalogs and for other reporting. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is a code indicating the group category defined by each Inventory Point (i.e., grouping like items for printing of catalogs and other reports).
