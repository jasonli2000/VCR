This file holds records containing the invariable information about the artifact, regardless of the physical storage location: CRC, FileSize, who the artifact was created by, a link back to the artifact descriptor, etc.  
 
It acts as the parent for one or more ArtifactInstance records, and holds the token that external clients will use to get a stream representing the artifact.
