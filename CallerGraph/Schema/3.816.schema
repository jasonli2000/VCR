The Distribution List file has entries that consist of names.  Each name is associated with one or more domain.  When a Distribution List is entered into a Mail Group, MailMan will deliver the message to all the entities it has linked to it.  A
Distribution List is interpreted as a name at which the message will be delivered to at each of the associated domains in the list.  Therefore a Distribution List whose NAME is G.SUPPORT and whose associated domains are  , ALTOONA,VA,GOV and ISC-SF  will 
be sent (in addition to all other entities attached to the Mail Group) to: 
 
    G.SUPPORT 
    G.SUPPORT@ALTOONA 
 &  G.SUPPORT@ISC-SF
