              DESCRIPTION:      The CODE is in the format "01 A" where the first two characters are numeric (the AMIS line number) followed by one space and then alphabetic characters.  CODE is needed for sorting in the proper sequence on reports, since
                                the computer sorts 1A, 1B, 2, 3 as 2, 3, 1A, 1B.
