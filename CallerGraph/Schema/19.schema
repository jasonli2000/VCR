Information in this file is used to drive the menu system.  Options are created, associated with others on menus, locked, set out-of-order, assigned prohibited times or devices, or given entry/exit actions.  The Edit Options of Menu Management should be
used (instead of VA FileMan) so that the global root (DIC) and other such fields are given the correct values.  Options may be tailored by setting FileMan variables via this file. The Order Enter/Results Reporting package is accessed by using the
appropriate option type.  It is cross-referenced by name, menu text, uppercase menu text, type, item, synonym, help frame, out-of-order message, lock, prohibited times, restricted devices, and priority.

              DESCRIPTION:          This field indicates the 'category' or type of option. A print-type option, for instance, will call FileMan to print something. Menu-type options point to other options in the tree-structured menu system. The other
                                fields in the options file are filled in depending on the type.  There are several fields that will tell a print-type option what to print and how to print it, for example.  These same fields may be meaningless to another
                                options type.

                                Menu System will not attempt to return the user to their previous option, but leave the user at the present stack location.  In the case of jumps, the user may be returned to an option that is quite far away if XQNOBACK is
                                not defined.  Obviously, the problem that resulted in an XQUIT should first be solved before XQNOBACK is set.
