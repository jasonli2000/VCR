This file is used for: 
  1.  If the outpatient pharmacy is using the verification feature all medication entered by a non-pharmacist will be identified in this file. The label is not printed for dispensing until a pharmacist can review the medication and verify that everything
is correct.  
   2.  The next use of this file is for medications that create drug/drug interactions.  While entering new medications, if two or more medications cause interactions, and the input is done by a non-pharmacist, the information about the interaction is
stored in the file until a pharmacist can review.
