This file provides the mechanism to group draft reports into logical categories to help in the efficent processing of these reports.  
 
Usually, an interpreting physician dictates a series of reports onto one tape. The transcriptionist receives the tape and the patient folders associated with the reports dictated on the tape. By placing the reports for that tape in a single batch,
usually by interpreting physician name, the following processes will be improved: 
 
         o re-printing the reports if the printer malfunctions.  
         o verifying the report can be done by batch with the 
           user only answering the 'report status' prompt for 
           each report. The system automatically proceeds through 
           the reports in the batch.  
         o if more than one transcriptionist has to print his/her reports 
           on the same printer then batch printing prevents 
           interweaving of each transcriptionist's reports.  
 
Naming of batches is controlled by the user and most often the name is the name of the interpreting physician whose dictation the user is transcribing. A user can only enter reports into a batch that he/she created.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the name given to this report batch by the transcriptionist when creating this batch.  Batch names must be between 3 and 30 characters in length.  
                                 
                                Usually the batch is given the name of the interpreting physician who dictated the reports onto audio tape.  
                                 
                                More than one transcriptionist may enter batches with the same name but the user is only allowed to remove and add reports to batches associated with his/her user access code.
