This file will be used by the software that processes routing rules and that governs the load-balancing of images to be viewed over a number of candidate recipients.  
 
The data in this file will be extremely volatile, and any data older than a day will be removed automatically.  
 
The load-balancer uses the data in this file in two ways: 
 - when the first image of a new study is being processed, 
   the load-balancer will calculate the designated recipient 
   for that study, based on the routing rule in question 
 - when subsequent images of that study are being processed 
   the load-balancer will ensure that they are transmitted 
   to the same destination.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Identify the routing rule for this record. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a pointer to a Routing Rule (file # 2006.59).  
                                 
                                The information in the current record describes how image files are being routed to destinations, and how the load per destination is balanced, based on a routing rule.  
                                 
                                The value of this field identifies the routing rule that governs the balancing act that is described in the current record.

                LAST EDITED:      APR 05, 2002 
                HELP-PROMPT:      Identify the image(group) to be routed. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a pointer to the Image File (# 2005).  
                                   
                                  While balancing the load over multiple destinations, all images for a given study should be sent to the same destination.  
                                   
                                  When the first image of a study is being routed, the balancer creates a new record in this multiple to indicate where all other images for the study to which that image belongs.  
                                   
                                  The value of this pointer identifies either the "parent" of a group of images, or a single image, if that image is a "group of 1".

                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the date on which this image is to be routed. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string that represents a date (no time part included). This date identifies the date on which an image file is being routed to a remote destination.  
                                   
                                  The load-balancer uses this date to balance the load (per day) over the various possible destinations.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Identify the destination for all images of this study. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a pointer to a destination.  This value is not a pointer in the "normal" sense that FileMan uses: it is the value of D2 in the reference 
                                    ^MAGDICOM(2006.59,D0,"ACTION",D1,1,D2,0) 
                                   
                                  This pointer identifies the data record that contains the identification of the destination (which is a variable pointer to either a Network Location (file # 2005.2) or a DICOM Application (file # 2006.585) to which all
                                  images of the current study are being transmitted.

              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is computed by the program that balances the load over multiple destinations.  
                                 
                                This value is a string that consists of a variable number of data elements (the number depends on the number of possible destinations in the routine rule, see file # 2006.59).  
                                 
                                The value for this string is calculated and updated in subroutine BALANCE^MAGBRTE2(IMAGE,RULE).

                    The subscripts in this cross-reference are:

                    For entries that belong to the current day, this cross-reference is used to decide the selection of the next destination that the load-balancer chooses for the transmission of a new study.
