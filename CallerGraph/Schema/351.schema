This file was introduced with v1.5 of Integrated Billing in conjunction with the automation of bills for Means Test charges.  The file is used to create and maintain billing clocks in which Means Test patients may be charged co-payment and per diem 
charges for Hospital or Nursing Home Care, as well as outpatient visits.  This file was initially populated by the Means Test data conversion that took place when v1.5 was installed.  Entries are subsequently updated and created by Integrated Billing.  
 
Entries in this file should not be deleted.  Billing clocks which are not correct will be cancelled, and new clocks may be added.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

                                Billing clocks which may have been "left open" due to a lack of billable activity will be closed during the nightly compilation job.  Billing clocks which must be deleted for any reason will have a status of CANCELLED.
