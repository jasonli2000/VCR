The DISPOSITION file contains the types of dispositions which might be given a patient when an application for care (registration) is dispositioned.  To insure that all related AMIS reports report correctly it is imperative that the various AMIS fields
within this file be defined as to the respective group in which the disposition falls for reporting purposes.  
 
Data in this file is seeded and maintained by the MAS module as directed by MAS VACO.  Editing, adding, or deleting data in this file may cause severe negative impacts on the operation of the MAS module.
