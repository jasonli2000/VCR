This file has been designed for joint use by the Indian Health Service and the Department of Veteran Affairs.  
 
Measurements, such as weight, height, blood pressure, etc., taken by a health professional at an outpatient encounter, will be stored in this file.  The patient name is a pointer to the Patient/IHS file, and the visit is a pointer to the Visit file. 
Both of these must exist before data can be entered in this record. This file contains one record for each measurement for a patient for each visit; therefore the key field (.01) will be duplicated.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the date and time that the measurement was taken by the provider.  This date and time may be different from the visit date and time.  For example, for clinic appointment visits, the visit date and time is the date
                                and time of the appointment, not the time that the provider performed the clinical event.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE User Interface, which allows manual entry of data, will be the primary source of the event date and time.  The event date prompt defaults to the visit date, and the time is entered to reflect the actual time the 
                                measurement was done.  The event date does not have to be the visit Date, but it must be within 30 days before or after the visit, and not be a future date.  
                                 
                                If a user wants to enter a historical measurement, the user should use the Historical Encounter entry action to document the historical measurement.  Historical entries will not be eligible for credit.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer is automatically entered by the PCE filing logic. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is populated automatically by the PCE filing logic.  The format of the field is as follows: Pointer to PCE Data source file_"-"_A for Add or E for Edit_" "_DUZ of the person who entered the data_";"...  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE filing logic requires a pointer to the PCE Data Source file.  If this is not passed, then PCE filing logic will not process the data.  
                                 
                                If the record is a new record, then an "A" is used to specify the source that added the data.  If the record existed previously, PCE filing logic compares the old and new records of information.  An "E" will be 
                                automatically used if the filing logic finds the data has been edited.  If "E" is used, then the Edited Flag field is automatically set to 1.  
                                 
                                The DUZ is stored in its internal format to represent the user who performed the adding or editing of data for this record.  
                                 
                                Iterations of editing will be concatenated to the previous Data Source value, up to 85 characters.
