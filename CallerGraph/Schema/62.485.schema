This file stores canned text for logging errors or exceptional conditions during message processing.  
 
This file should not be edited locally by the site, but if a local messaging system is developed, and entries must be added, the site should add new entries at entry numbers higher than 999. It is preferred that the local codes be preceded with the three
digit primary site number which would result in a seven digit number, site #_xxxx.

                                This field holds the text description of the error or exceptional condition.  This field is used to create an error or exceptional condition display in the ^XTMP global.

                                can be added to the text by using the "|" character and the LA7TXT()| array.  
                                 
                                Example Text: Message # |1| did not contain a PID segment.  Array value: LA7TXT(1)=123 ^XTMP: Message # 123 did not contain a PID segment.
