Lab Electronic Codes file contains a collection of codes used in electronic messaging. Some of these codes originated in established recognized sources (i.e. HL7 tables). Other codes are unique to the laboratory package needs or requirements.  
 
This file is a standard file for many types of terms used in electronic messaging.
