As images are being processed by VistA DICOM Image ext Gateways, statistics are being logged about the number and nature of these images.  
 
The entries in this file keep track for every instrument that produces images of whether or not the instrument is currently connected, whether or not an association is currently established.  This file also tallies on a day-by-day basis how many
associations have been established, and how many image files have been transmitted.
