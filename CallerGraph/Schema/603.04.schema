                LAST EDITED:      JUN 28, 2006 
                DESCRIPTION:      Most sites report WBC and Neutorphil results in K/unit format (K/cc or K/cu mm or K/mm-3 or K/mL). For example, WBC equals 5.1.  However, some report results as discrete units. For example, WBC equals 5100.  This field
                                  will allow the site to specify how results are reported.
