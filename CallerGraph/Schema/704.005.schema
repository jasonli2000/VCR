This file will hold a subset of patient movement data.  This must be done rather than using a direct reference to the PATIENT MOVEMENT file (#405) because, in the instance of cancellations, the internal entry number (ien) of a patient movement disappears
before there is the chance to work with it.  This file will coalesce all of a movement's data to send to 3rd party users.  That data is sent to 3rd party users via Health Level Seven (HL7) messaging.  To ensure that message is available to 3rd party
users, the ACCEPTED BY QUEUE field (#.09) is set to '1' to confirm the message is in the HL7 outbound queue; that CP MOVEMENT AUDIT file entry will then need to be purged.

  LAST (#911)    RECORD    REGULAR    IR    LOOKUP & SORTING
      Short Descr:  Index by Patient, Message and Event type, and Date.
      Description:  This index will allow us to search for the most recent message type and event type for a patient.  The intended use case is that, in some instances, cancellations of transfers or discharges may be sent several months after the event
                    to which they refer in order to make the G & L sheets balance correctly.  We will NOT wish to propagate these events to the devices.  So, if we receive a movement cancel request (an A11, A12, or A13), we will check to see what the
                    most recent movement was.  If it doesn't match what was in the most recent A01, A02, or A03, then we'll just drop the message.
