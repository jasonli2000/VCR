              DESCRIPTION:      The AR form letter name identifies the Form Letter number.  Follow-up letters are sent to debtor's based on the bill(s) existing for the debtor.  When a certain bill is to be generated, the AR package will print the
                                appropriate letter to be attached to the bill.  
                                 
                                The name of the letter SHOULD NEVER be edited as the AR package looks for letters based on the name.  If the name is changed, then this will cause the letter not to be generated.
