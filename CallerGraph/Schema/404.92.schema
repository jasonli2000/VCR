This file contains the definitions for hard coded scheduling reports that are available to the user on a client workstation.  
 
These definitions are pre-determined and must not be modified unless explicitly instructed as part of a patch or module upgrade.  
 
The parameters specified in each report definition are used by the client application. The parameters indicate what prompts are presented to the user, which prompts are required as part report criteria.  
 
Also, where possible, a default value is specified that is used when first displaying the prompt.

                                Most reports require at least the selection of one entry from each file in the multiple.  However, there is at least one report where only one selection is allowed for the file. Also, there is at least one report that does
                                not require any selection to be made if the user desires the report to search for null values.

                                  For example, typically when selecting entries from the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file, the user is restricted to entries that are assoicated INSTITUTION file entries made as part of the report criteria.  
                                   
                                  The Query Template Utility uses this parameter during the 'validation' check.
