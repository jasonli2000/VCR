This site parameter file contains a QUERY INCOME YEAR multiple which contains information for Queries received from the IVM center.  The IVM PARAMETER file will be used in IVM v2 to hold several parameters which shall be used to control the uploading of
verified demographic and Means Test data from the IVM Center.  This file is being introduced with patch IVM*1*2, with the single parameter entry only containing the Station number.  The parameter file is needed for this patch to capture the query
information sent to the site by the IVM Center when a request for a full data transmission for all patients is submitted.  The query information is stored so that the request may be processed outside of peak hours when the nightly background job is run.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
