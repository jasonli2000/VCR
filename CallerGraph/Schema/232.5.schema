              LAST EDITED:      MAR 13, 2012 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 2-7 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the xml abbreviation for the role. Previously, logic had been hardcoded to check the role type.  
                                 
                                'P' = "@md" 'N' = "@rn" 'R' = "@res" 
                                 
                                These values will remain the same, however they are now part of the file, and can be more easily enhanced to add roles in the future. The roles will now be able to be built without having to release a KIDS build to do so.
                                All role settings are now table driven.  
                                 
                                This is accessed and used to build information out of the CLRSTAFF tag in EDPQDBS.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Any time a new role is added, the UI will need to change to be able to consume the new role type. In addition to this field, the XML ROLE NAME will need to be entered in order to pass the needed information back to the
                                client application.  
                                 
                                There is flexibility in the use of these two fields, however they MUST be defined when creating a new role.  
                                 
                                For example: 
                                 Currently for the role of 'Provider', the XML ABBREVIATION field is "@md", and the XML ROLE NAME is 'providers'. As long as these fields are unique to this role, the API's will build meaningful information for the client
                                to consume.
