This file holds the expansion of the number codes that represent the additional warnings/consultations that may be needed for a particular drug.  The DRUG file informally points to this file, in much the same way that it points to the Medication
Instruction file.  The field that points to this file is WARNING LABELS and it essentially requires that the numbers entered here be valid entries in this file.  
 
These numbers are printed on the labels with the idea that the pharmacy would attach the appropriate warning stickers to the bottle.  
 
Data storage moved to PS(54 from DIC(54 with version 7 of Outpatient Pharmacy.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field contains the Spanish translation for the old RX CONSULT file (#54) warning label. It will be initially populated only for the "Do not transfer" warning label number 20. When possible, the new warning label 
                                source should be used and the Spanish translation is available from the WARNING LABEL-SPANISH file (#50.626). This file will be used when a patient has a PMI language preference of Spanish and when the PHARMACY SYSTEM file
                                (#59.7) WARNING LABEL SOURCE field (#16) is set to "N" for "NEW".
