This file hold records that relate to the scheduling of options to run on a one time basis or more likely on a schedule.  There is one record for each time that an option is scheduled.  This allows one option to be scheduled to run on more that one CPU
or at more that one time without having to duplicated the option in the option file.

              DESCRIPTION:      If this Option is set for "STARTUP", then TaskMan will queue the job to run whenever the TaskMan/computer is started up, i.e. at System Boot. If this Option is set for "Startup/Persistent", then Taskman will queue the job
                                as it does for "STARTUP" and it will mark it as a persistent task to be restarted if it stops unexpectedly.  If this Option is set for "Persistent" then TaskMan will run it on its normal schedule, marking it as Persistent,
                                This way TaskMan will restart the task if it stops unexpectedly.  When a task stop in a normal fashion its persistent flag will be cleared.
