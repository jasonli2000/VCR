                                be released when the event occurs.  If this date/time is in the future, this event may continue to be selected for delaying orders until this time passes.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the type of event that should cause delayed orders to be released. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the event that should cause delayed orders to be released to the service(s) for action; for OR (Surgery) events, the orders will be released when TIME PAT IN OR (#130,.205) is entered in the Surgery package.  
                                 
                                Orders delayed for Manual Release will not be automatically released by CPRS at all and can only be released via the "Release to Service" action by a user who is authorized to do so.  Authorization is controlled by the
                                parameter OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL, which lets sites choose whether release is controlled by keys or by the parameter OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE or both.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the number of days to allow orders for this event to remain delayed for a patient.  Patient Events are evaluated whenever delayed orders are acted upon or viewed, and if this number of days has passed since delayed
                                orders were entered for this event for the patient then the status of all orders delayed for this event will be changed to "lapsed" and the Patient Event itself will be terminated.  The orders can no longer be released to

              DESCRIPTION:      This is an MAS Movement Type that can further define this event; it is optional, but if defined then it must match the patient's movement data to satisfy the event and cause any delayed orders to be released.  For example,
                                to have delayed orders released when a patient returns from pass enter the movement type of AUTH ABSENCE 96 HOURS OR LESS, or leave this field empty to have the transfer event defined by other criteria such as treating

              DESCRIPTION:      Many order dialogs use parameters that depend on location; this field will be used as the default location for retrieving those parameter values when delaying orders to this event.  The patient's actual location will be

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES if the user should be prompted to copy active orders when writing new delayed orders for this event. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field determines whether or not the user will be presented with the patient's active orders, which may then be copied to the delayed event being created.

                                If this field is set to yes then the user will be shown the patient's active orders and the user may select orders to be copied to the delayed event.  The list of active orders will be presented to the user after the ORDER
                                DIALOG for the release event is processed (if it exists) and before the ORDER SET/MENU for the release event is processed (if it exists).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter release event that will be the "parent" event for this event 
              DESCRIPTION:      For release events that have a common trigger event (e.g. same treating specialty or same locations) but require different names or display text a parent-child relationship can be set up.  The parent contains the base
                                trigger event logic while the child contains the information unique to this event.  In a sense, the child events are "synonyms" to the parent event as all childen are related to the parent.  When the trigger event occurs
                                that would release orders for the parent all the child orders related to that parent are also released.
