Holds all requests for 7131 information.  This is the information which was requested on the old paper 7131 forms.  
 
Node 6 was added with Version 2.7 of AMIE.  This node contains the divisions a selected report on a 7131 has been transferred to.  Node 7 was added with Version 2.7 of AMIE.  This node contains the dates a report on a 7131 was transferred to another
division.  These nodes are used only by Multidivisional facilities that transfer reports on a 7131.  The decimal portion of the field numbers for the fields on nodes 6 and 7 indicates the node the field exists on.  The piece position for each field on
nodes 6 and 7 corresponds to the piece position of its respective report status field on that report's node.  
 
NOTE:  The 'AE' and 'AF' cross-references are specialized MUMPS cross- references used to implement the Divisional Transfer of reports on a 7131 request.  Please follow the technical descriptions of the above cross-references when reindexing.

                                This cross reference will be used by the New 7131 Request Report (Long).  It is needed to print a 7131 at the Division the request has been sent to by the Regional Office.  
                                 
                                To reindex the 'AE' X-ref for these fields, the user need only reindex  either the Date of Request or Division.  This will NOT reindex the 'AE' X-ref on other fields in the file.
