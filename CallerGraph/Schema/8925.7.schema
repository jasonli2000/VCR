This file is intended to accommodate the case where multiple cosignatures are applied to a document (e.g., team or multi-disciplinary notes, discharge planning check-lists, etc.).  Rather than adding a multiple to the TIU Document file, this file
supports a 3NF decomposition, allowing multiple cosignatures to be applied to the same document.

              LAST EDITED:      JUL 06, 2005 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is set by a trigger on the .05 field (ACTUAL COSIGNER). The trigger will check if the actual cosigner is a surrogate for the expected signer at the time of signing. If so this field will be set to 1. If not it
                                will be set to 0. This will enable other processes to know if the Additional Signer was signed by a surrogate as the assignment of the surrogate is temporary and cannot be checked at a later date.
