              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a whole number between 12 and 66. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The labels that you use may vary in height from 12 to 66 lines.  Measure the height of your label and multiply that height by the number of lines per inch that your printer is configured for.  NOTE: If all lines of print
                                cannot fit within the length that 
                                      is defined here, they will continue to the next label.  EXAMPLE: 
                                    The average piggyback label is 3 inches high.  If you print 
                                    6 lines per inch, you should enter an '18' as the answer to 
                                    this parameter.

              DESCRIPTION:      When set to "YES", an extra label is generated to record lot #'s and provide a record for new orders entered since the last printing of the active order list. This extra label, together with the active order list provides
                                a paper backup system in the event that the computer system becomes "unavailable" to the user.

              DESCRIPTION:      The 'ACTIVITY RULER' provides a visual representation of the relationship between coverage times, doses due and order start times.  The intent is to provide the 'on-the-floor' user with a means of 'tracking' activity in
                                the IV room and determining when to call for doses before the normal delivery.

                                   If an order was given with an infusion rate of 220 ml/hr and a total 
                                   volume of 1000 ML, the unit needs would be: DAY  :  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14 UNIT :  5   5   5   6   5   5   6   5   5   5   6   5   5   6
