              DESCRIPTION:      Enter in this field the name of a Recall "subset". If your site chooses to have all clinical areas send out recall notifications the same number of days before a recall date, all areas would be using Recall Letters, and 
                                all areas want to scan patient scheduled appointments the same number of days, you would need to only enter one entry.  This entry can be your site's name. But, if your site has areas that want to have different settings
                                for notification type, timeframe to send out cards/letters or the number of days to scan for looking at scheduled appointments then you would want separate entries.
