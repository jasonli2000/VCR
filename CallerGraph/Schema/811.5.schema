This file defines Clinical Reminder terms. Terms have a number of uses, including as findings in a reminder definition, as finding rules for building patient lists, and as elements of extract finding groups.  
 
This file contains a combination of national, local, and VISN level terms. Nationally distributed entries will have a CLASS of "National" and the name is prefixed with "VA-". Any terms created at your site should have a CLASS of "Local". Terms created
for VISN use will have a CLASS of "VISN" 
 
Before a term can be used, it must have findings mapped to it. The findings that can be mapped to a term are any of the standard Clinical Reminder findings with the exception of terms.  
 
Reminder terms are useful for national reminders involving findings that are based on local file definitions (e.g., laboratory test, drug file, radiology). National reminder terms have limited editing capabilities, which allow sites to map their local
finding items to a term. Sites may create local reminder terms, providing an easy way to group a variety of findings and treat them the same way in a reminder.  
 
When a reminder with terms is evaluated, the finding items mapped to the term are used to find the patient data, but the patient data is reported based on the term the data is mapped to.

                                    DA(1) is the internal entry number in file # 811.5.  
                                    GLOBAL is the global name of the global that defines the finding.  
                                     For example, the global name for file #811.5 is ^PXRMD(811.5,.

                                    DA is the finding number.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field applies only to health factors. In order to understand how it works, you need to understand how health factors work in the reminder evaluation process. If you are not clear about this, see the health factor
                                  section of the Clinical Reminders Manager Manual.  
                                   
                                  The default behavior is to use only the most recent health factor within a category. A problem can arise if there are two or more health factors within a category and they both have the same date. (This can happen if
                                  both health factors are given during the same encounter). When the dates are the same, the health factor with the highest WITHIN CATEGORY RANK will be used. This is a numerical value like RANK FREQUENCY, with 1 being the
                                  highest rank.  
                                   
                                  If WITHIN CATEGORY RANK has the special value of 0, then the categorization of health factors will be ignored and the health factor will be treated as a distinct finding.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3-225 characters in length. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The CONDITION must be written in M code based on the value returned from the patient results for the finding. Each type of finding has a specific field that provides the value available to use in the CONDITION logic.  If
                                  the finding value is text, enclose the condition value in quotes (e.g., "positive"). If the finding value is numeric, do not use quotes (e.g., 3).  
                                   
                                  An IF statement is used to evaluate the value.  The value is always identified as V in the statement, regardless of the type of finding. If the condition logic statement evaluates to true, the finding is considered as
                                  found (true); otherwise the finding is considered as not found (false).  
                                   
                                  Relational operators that may be used include: = equals, < less than, > greater than, [ contains, ] follows and ? pattern matches. Logical operators may be used to check multiple values: & And, ! Or, ' Not. 
                                           
                                  Typical examples of M code are as follows: 
                                      I V=3 for Education Topic's Level of Understanding = 3 
                                      I V="H" for Health Factor's Level/Severity="H" 
                                      I ($P(V,"/",1)>140)&($P(V,"/",2)>90) for elevated blood pressure 
                                      systolic and diastolic values 
                                      I ($P(V,"/",1)>140)!($P(V,"/",2)>90) for elevated blood pressure 
                                      systolic or diastolic values 
                                      I V["BLACK" for VA-RACE computed finding where race contains BLACK

                                  Note - if the finding has both a STATUS LIST and a CONDITION the status check will be made first; the CONDITION will be applied only if the finding passes the status check.

                                    certain possible statuses assigned to it. The editors will evaluate the finding items and allow the users to select a status only from an appropriate list of statuses for that finding item.
