  The IV ADDITIVES file contains drugs which will be used as additives in the IV room. Any drug entered in this file must already exist in the DRUG file (50). All drug information relating to its use in the IV package is stored in the IV ADDITIVES file.
If a drug is no longer to be used as an IV additive, DO NOT delete it from the IV ADDITIVE file, but simply inactivate it by entering the date it is to be dis- continued in the INACTIVATION field.
