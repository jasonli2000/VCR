USED BY GENERIC INVENTORY SYSTEM.  
  This file is used to keep a log of ANY transaction that affects the inventory level.  The file will be updated ONLY if the flag on the inventory point "KEEP DETAILED TRX.HISTORY" is set to "Y" (YES).  Records are then automatically added to the file
during the processing of any transaction that affects the inventory level (receiving, distribution, usage, manual adjustments, etc.)  NOTE:  THIS FILE SHOULD BE PURGED FREQUENTLY!!!
