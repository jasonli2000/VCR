This file stores the FMS documents for the batch type FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT.  
 
This file is used to manage the transmission of the FMS code sheets between DHCP and FMS.  When FMS code sheets are created manually or automatically, the code sheets are queued for transmission or transmitted immediately from this file.  
 
This file is used internally by the Generic Code Sheet System and should not be edit through VA FileMan.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field stores an option document lookup key that can be used to find a specific document in generic code sheets.  For example, if a package sends a monthly code sheet, it could enter the key as SV-3001200 for SV
                                documents sent for the month 12/2000.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to store the size of the code sheet.  The field is used internally by the Generic Code Sheet Package during transmission.  When the code sheets are transmitted from the stack file, the code sheets are
                                grouped into mail messages depending on the size of the code sheet.
