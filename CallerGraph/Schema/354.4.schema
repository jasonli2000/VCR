This file will only be populated if a site chooses to use the Alert functionality available in Kernel v7 instead of receiving mail messages  This is determined by the field USE ALERTS in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file.  
 
The entries will contain the name of the alert and after it has been resolved, who resolved the alert.  The entries in this file will automatically be deleted by the nightly background job, IB MT NIGHT COMP.  Resolved alerts will be deleted after 30
days, unresolved alerts will be deleted after 60 days.  
 
The data in the file is automatically entered by the system when either a detectable error occurs or when an action occurs that requires automatic notification for fiscal integrity (such as giving a hardship notification).  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
