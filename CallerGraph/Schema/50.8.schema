                DESCRIPTION:        This field is the holding file for IV STATS that are to be counted.  When a COUNTED IV label is run, this field is updated by the computer.  Pertinent information about the 'COUNTED IV LABEL' is saved and will be
                                  compiled later by a job that is automatically queued to run at 1 AM in the morning.  All IV STATS can be compiled immediately by running the 'COMPILE IV STATS' option in the supervisor menu.  The 'COMPILE IV STATS'
                                  option should not be used regularly, since it is very CPU intensive and is automatically run each day.
