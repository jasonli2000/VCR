                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string ($Horolog format) that indicates the date and time that the current status was established.  
                                   
                                  This value is used when checking on files that are in a status of "transmission in progress". When a file is too long in this status, the current entry will be moved back to a status of "waiting for transmission".  
                                   
                                  See the RPC named "MAG DICOM GET NEXT QUEUE ENTRY" for the actual time-lag that decides on a change-back of the status.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the name of the "place" from which the image originates. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                The value of this field is a pointer (to the Institution file, #4).  This pointer identifies the "place" where the image is permanently stored.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter an integer number to represent the priority of this queue entry. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a positive integer number.  This number indicates the relative priority of an entry in the queue.  
                                 
                                A higher number indicates a higher priority, i.e. when two entries have different priorities, the entry with the higher priority will be processed before the one with the lower priority.

              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string that represents a DICOM Unique Object Identifier. A DICOM UID is a string that consists of up to 64 characters, each character must be either a digit or a period, no two consecutive
                                periods are allowed, none of the series of consecutive digits may start with a zero.  
                                 
                                This UID identifies the study to which the images belong that are included in the current entry.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether or not a copy of the image is to be made on RAID. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a code that indicates whether or not a copy of the image file(s) is to be made on RAID.  A value of 0 indicates that no copy is to be made on RAID.  A value of 1 indicates that a copy should be
                                made.
