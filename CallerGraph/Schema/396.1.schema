              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the C&P appointment control parameter for the C&P Integrity report. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is an On/Off switch controlling inclusion of the C&P Appointment Report in the C&P Integrity Report.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This is an On/Off switch referenced by AMIE software.  If turned Off, the site will not receive the C&P appointment part of the integrity report.  If On, the user will receive this report with the integrity report.  The 
                                functionality of this parameter is not supported nationally and this field is reserved for other purposes in future versions.  
                                 
                                This parameter is different from the 2507 INTEGRITY REPORT STATUS parameter in that it will over ride the value in the 2507 INTEGRITY REPORT STATUS parameter for the additional report generated with version 2.7.  If the 
                                C&P REPORT PARAMETER is turned off, the unlinked appointment report will not be included with the C&P Integrity Report regardless of the value of the 2507 INTEGRITY REPORT STATUS parameter.  The C&P REPORT PARAMETER will
                                allow the site to list those 2507 requests lacking appointment links on the C&P Integrity Report without printing the unlinked appointment report.  
                                 
                                AGAIN: This parameter is not supported in the release of V2.7 but is included to allow future support of this functionality.  Future versions of AMIE may remove this parameter and the potential functionality it provides.
