This file contains monthly closing dollar balances by station, fund, and standard general ledger for capitalized non-expendable equipment. The values for the current month are automatically updated when Fixed Assets (FAP) Documents are transmitted. If
there has not been any activity in a given month the dollar balance for that month can be obtained by looking at the preceeding month which has a value.  
 
The dollar balances are solely based on FAP Document code sheets. The values in this file can be recalculated from the FAP Documents if neccessary. See the Recalculate FAP Balances option for more information.  
 
This file must not be directly edited or locally modified.
