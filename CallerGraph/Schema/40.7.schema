The Clinic Stop file (#40.7) contains all AMIS Stop Codes and their associated Name, Restriction Type (E-Either, P-Primary Only, or S-Secondary Only), and if applicable, Restriction Date (for P or S Restriction Types).  If a clinic stop entry is
inactive, there is an Inactive Date.  
 
This file has been "Locked Down" so that Fileman and other user updates are not allowed.  Changes may be made only through VistA Maintenance (VM) patches coordinated with Decision Support Office (DSO) and Enterprise Product Services (EPS). The file
definition (data dictionary) shall not be modified.  All additions, changes, inactivations, and reactivations to entries in the file shall be accomplished only by VM patches.  Creating new Stop Codes or local Stop Codes, and/or editing fields in the
file, is not permitted.  The one exception is described as follows: 
 
Users may use the Scheduling option SD EDIT LOCAL STOP CODE (which requires SD SUPERVISOR key)  to edit the Name of the "locally defined" Stop Codes which are set aside for local use:  451-456, 458-473, 475-479, and 482-485.
