                                instrument.  An example of this status would be a consent form scanned in via the VistA Imaging Capture Workstation that creates a CP Study record stub with a TIU document but allows further input with the CPUser 
                                application.

                                VistA Imaging server.  A study in this status is not accessible until VistA Imaging returns a status of Complete or Error and logs any errors encountered in the submission process.

                                attachments sent to the VistA Imaging server. Error messages are logged with the transaction and can be reviewed by users when opening the transaction in an error status.

                                were included they have been successfully copied to the VistA Imaging server.

                                Users may open these transactions and view the Consult/Procedure order as well as assign instrument results to the study.  Once these steps have been done this study can be submitted to VistA Imaging.  
                                 
                                5: Pending Instrument Data                                             This transaction has been submitted to a bi-directional instrument and is awaiting that instrument to return the results of the procedure.  
                                Transactions in this status should not be opened until the instrument has returned the results, assigned them to the study, and marked it as Ready to Complete.
