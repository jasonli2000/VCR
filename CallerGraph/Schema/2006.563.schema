This table contains only one entry.  The information in this entry defines the customization for the DICOM Gateway Processor on which this table is stored.  Note that some site-specific parameters apply to the whole site, those parameters are stored in
the table "IMAGING SITE PARAMETERS", and other parameters apply to the individual PCs. The latter parameters are stored in this table.

              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a timestamp (VA FileMan format, date only) that indicates the start of the time-period during which communication with the PACS was conducted using the Pre Version 12.1 protocol.  
                                 
                                When querying the PACS, the query process will issue its queries according to this protocol for all studies that were conducted between the start and end dates that are registered in this field (and the next).  
                                 
                                Note that protocol-eras are allowed to overlap. The result of registering overlapping protocol eras will be that the query process will issues its requests according to all protocols that could have been valid at the time.
                                The PACS, on the other hand, will only respond to requests that correspond to the protocol that was actually active at the time.
