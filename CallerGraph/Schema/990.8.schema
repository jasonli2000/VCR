              LAST EDITED:      AUG 15, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the mail group to which package-generated status messages should be sent. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the mail group to whom package-critical status messages should be sent.  


990.8,1       RECENT RESULTS INDEX RETENTION 0;2 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>999999999)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 15, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the number of days after which entries in the recent results index will be deleted. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Whenever new data are stored in the COR, an entry is made in the Recent Results Index that shows the date when the entry was stored.  This index can be used when browsing the COR to restrict the search to data stored 
                                within the recent past.  This parameter permits the site to dictate how many days worth of data are to be tracked by this index.  The nightly purge will remove any entries older than the threshold set by this parameter. 
                                Typical values will range from 3-5 days, but should be determined by local clinical needs and storage capacity.  


990.8,2       ACCESS LOG RETENTION   0;3 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>999999999)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 15, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the number of days after which entries in the ACCESS LOG file will be deleted. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter dictates how many days worth of CIRN ACCESS LOG data are to be maintained.  Entries older than this threshold are removed by the nightly purge.  The value of this parameter is entirely up to the discretion
                                of the local site.  Obviously, larger values will incur more storage requirements.  


990.8,3       TRANSMITTED RESULT RETENTION 0;4 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>999999999)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      NOV 06, 1996 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the number of days after which verified entries in the data entry holding area will be deleted. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Number of days to retain verified and transmitted data from the CIRN data entry holding area.  Data older than this threshold are deleted by the nightly purge.  


990.8,4       EXCEPTION LOG RETENTION 0;6 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>999999999)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      NOV 06, 1996 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Number of days to retain data in CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Number of days to retain entries in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG file.  See a description of this file for information about its purpose.  Entries older than this threshold are removed by the nightly purge.  


990.8,5       SUPPRESS EXCEPTION ALERTS? 0;7 SET

                                '0' FOR NO; 
                                '1' FOR YES; 
              LAST EDITED:      MAR 11, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      If yes, alerts are not sent when exceptions are encountered on sending and receiving HL7 messages. 
              DESCRIPTION:      When set to yes, this parameter suppresses the generation of all alerts or email messages when an exception is logged.  This setting overrides that specified for individual exception types.  It is advisable to set this
                                parameter to yes during historical load operations to avoid transmitting large numbers of alerts.  


990.8,6       MINIMAL EXCEPTION LOGGING? 0;8 SET

                                '0' FOR NO; 
                                '1' FOR YES; 
              LAST EDITED:      MAR 25, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      If yes, log entries are created only if an exception occurred. 
              DESCRIPTION:      If yes, entries are created in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION file only if an exception is logged.  Otherwise, an entry is created each time an event or message is processed.  The latter permits better tracking of background
                                activity, but at the expense of greater storage consumption.  


990.8,10      STANDARD TIMEZONE      TZ;1 POINTER TO MAILMAN TIME ZONE FILE (#4.4)

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 27, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Standard time zone for this site. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is a pointer to the MAILMAN TIME ZONE file (#4.4) and indicates the standard time zone for this site.

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 27, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Daylight savings timezone for this site.  Leave blank if location does not honor DST. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Timezone active during daylight savings time.  If this locale does not honor daylight savings time, you may either leave this entry blank or enter same timezone as standard time.
