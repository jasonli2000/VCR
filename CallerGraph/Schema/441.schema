                                When an amendment is obligated the FCP should already be established.  If that is so then the action done within CHK^PRCHCRD shouldn't be needed then.  
                                   
                                CHK^PRCHCRD sees if the 4 node is set up.  If it isn't the subroutine sets it up.  The .01 field, FCP, is entered, The 'B' x-ref is entered and the 0 node of the subfile is updated.  Maby FILE^DICN could do all this work
                                without the programmer having to play FileMan?

441.03,1        PURCHASE ORDER         1;0 POINTER Multiple #441.04 (Add New Entry without Asking)

                DESCRIPTION:
                                  This is a purchase order that uses this item.  

                TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field, the PURCHASE ORDER multiple, is entered from EN3^PRCHCRD.  EN3^PRCHCRD is called from the REPETITIVE (PR CARD) NO. field in the ITEM multiple in file 442.  The 'AD' x-ref within the REPETITIVE (PR CARD) NO.
                                  field actually has the call.  The SET part of the x-ref checks that the PURCHASE ORDER multiple is set up and, if required, sets it up.  Then the purchase order from file 442 that is using this ITEM is entered in the
                                  multiple along with entering the 'AC' x-ref for the entry.  Finally the subfile's 0 node is updated to show that a new entry was added. After all that a jump is made to LST^PRCHCRD1 which copies fields from file 441 into
                                  file 442.  
                                     
                                  This field has its data deleted within EN4^PRCHCRD.  EN4^PRCHCRD is called from the KILL part of the 'AC' x-ref mentioned above. The KILL part of the x-ref just removes the entry from the multiple, kills the 'AC' x-ref
                                  entry and reduces the record count in the subfile's 0 node by 1.  
                                     
                                  Maby the action EN3^PRCHCRD does could be done by FILE^DICN? The action EN4^PRCHCRD handles might be done with DIK? 
                                     
                                  The amemdment action required, when the amendment is entered into file 442, would be what EN3^PRCHCRD already does without the jump to LST ^PRCHCRD1.  If the amendment action removes this ITEM from the purchase order
                                  then do what EN4^ PRCHCRD does instead.
