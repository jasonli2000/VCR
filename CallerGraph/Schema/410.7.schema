This file contains the Control Point's Sort Group.  This is used as a sorting mechanism of requests to categorize their particular or specific cost distribution.  Each Control Point specifies a particular Sort Group and only sees their Sort Group. This
is one of the files that is pointed-to from the Sort Group field of the Control Point Activity File (#410).  The other file that the Sort Group field points to is the Engineering Work Order File.
