This file is used to facilitate the approval of ROES eligibilities that are entered by ASPS (Audiology and Speech Pathology Service) and are required to be approved by PSAS (Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service). All of the fields are populated by data
from the ROES3.exe and the Vista RMPFDE2 option.  No direct editing should be necessary.  ROES3 is a GUI application that is accessed from the CPRS Tools menu.  Through ROES 3, ASPS connects to the DDC web site to order supplies for patients.  If the
patient does not have pre-appoved eligibility for ROES orders, it must be sent to PSAS for approval, before the order can be placed. A message is sent to the RMPF ROES UPDATES (PSAS) mail group that a request was entered.  PSAS uses the RMPFDE2 option to
evaluate the request and a message back to the RMPF ROES UPDATES (ASPS) mail group is sent. From that time, when the ROES application is accessed for the patient, the action by PSAS will be noted and the connection will be made if the eligibility was
approved.
