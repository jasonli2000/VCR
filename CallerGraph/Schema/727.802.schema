This file contains data elements as specified by the Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office for the MAS Admission extract from existing DHCP files. Entries into this file are made by extracting data from several files. Once approved by the DSS site
manager, entries in this file are loaded into an electronic mail message and sent to the commercial vendor. This file is intended to be used for validation purposes only. Entries should be made only by the extract load routine.  
  
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.  However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference, the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT
NUMBER field (#2).  This cross reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be modified.  
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                Self-reported by patient as recorded in VistA patient file.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Using the patient pointer (DFN) stored in the PATIENT NO. - DFN field (#4), RACE 1 is derived from the PTF VALUE field (#5) of the RACE file (#10) pointed to by the RACE INFORMATION field (#.01) of the RACE INFORMATION
                                subfile (#2.02) of the PATIENT file (#2).  
                                 
                                Only those RACE INFORMATION values in the RACE INFORMATION subfile (#2.03) where the METHOD OF COLLECTION field (#.02) is set to 1 (SELF-IDENTIFICATION), will be included in the RACE 1 field. Up to 6 race entries can be
                                included. If any of the RACE INFORMATION values returned is "C" (DECLINED TO ANSWER), that will be the only value included in the RACE1 field.  
                                 
                                If the RACE 1 field is null after checking the RACE INFORMATION values then the patient's historical RACE data will be checked to see if it contains one of the twenty six non-standard race values that are convertible to
                                standard race values.  If so, the race value will be converted to the standard value and stored in the RACE 1 field.
