This file holds the various retention policies available to the storage subsystem. They come in two varieties: user-definable, and business.  
 
User-definable retention policies can be created and mapped to artifact descriptors, to serve as intrinsic retention policies. They can be inactivated, or "logically deleted", but only if no artifact descriptors are pointing to them. They can never be
physically deleted, since there are artifacts that still point to the old retention policies, and we need to keep the historical record of retention policies that have been applied to this artifact over time.  
 
Business retention policies are designed to be called by business code for certain patients (e.g., Agent Orange retention policy, Employee retention policy, etc.). These retention policies will be installed with the patch and can be "replaced" with
updated versions, but not deleted, since business logic will presumably expect to find them.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-64 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Holds a key that can be used by clients to look up retention policies for specific business scenarios, e.g. Agent Orange cases, employees, etc.  
                                 Business Key is not unique across all records, but must be unique among active records. In other words, you could have deactivated versions of old business keys (if already-captured artifacts are grandfathered in on the
                                old policy), and a new, active record with the same key, so that newly acquired records follow the new policy.

                                '1' FOR Active; 
              LAST EDITED:      AUG 04, 2011 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Select retention policy status. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Since many artifacts may be linked to a retention policy, it is not safe to delete records. However, the policy can be deactivated by setting this flag to false ("0"), so that it won't be assigned to newly acquired 
                                artifacts.
