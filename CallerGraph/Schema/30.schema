This file contains the reasons for which a disposition may not have been completed on time.  The user defines a parameter using the ADT Parameter Entry/Edit option indicating after which timeframe a disposition is considered to be late.  When
dispositioning an application using the MAS module if the timeframe between the date/time of application and the date/time of disposition exceeds that parameter the user will be prompted to indicate the reason the disposition was late.  The response to
the prompt must be an entry in this file.  
 
This file is maintained by the MAS software module and should not be altered at the site level.
