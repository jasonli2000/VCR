DO NOT delete entries in this file.  DO NOT edit data in this file with VA File Manager.  
 
Entries in this file are created by other applications calling approved application specific routines.  This file is the link between Accounts Receivable and an application.  Integrated billing will attempt to aggregate charges where possible to reduce
the number of account entries necessary.  Resolution of charges from Accounts Receivable would then be accomplished through Integrated Billing.  
 
Entries in this file will not be deleted or edited (except for the status field, cancellation reasons filed, last updated field, and user last updating field).  Rather than deleting an entry, an entry is "reversed" by creating an additional entry with
the IB ACTION TYPE entry that cancels the original entry.  An entry is edited by creating the cancellation entry and then adding an updated new entry.  All entries related to the original entry will be related by the PARENT LINK field.  
 
There is also an IB ACTION type that is an event, which may include Hospital admissions, NHCU admissions, and outpatient visits.  All of the charges associated with an event will be related to that event by the EVENT LINK field.  
 
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the current status of this entry.  The IB routines will maintain this field.  An entry will be incomplete when it is created, complete when all data needed to pass to AR is there, and Billed after passing to AR and
                                the bill number and/or transaction number have been added.  
                                 
                                If the entry represents a billable inpatient/NHCU admission (event), the status will be Incomplete while the patient is admitted, and then Complete when the patient has been discharged.  All entries created during the
                                Means Test conversion will have the status Converted Record.  
                                 
                                With Integrated Billing version 2.0, this field is changed from a set of codes field to a pointer which points to the IB ACTION STATUS (#350.21) file.  This change will allow new action statuses to be added more easily,
                                and permit various characteristics to be assigned to the statuses to facilitate system processing.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THESE NEW POINTED-TO ENTRIES HAVE AN INTERNAL ENTRY NUMBER IN FILE #350.21 WHICH IS EQUAL TO THEIR
                                PREVIOUS CODE VALUE.  PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE IB ACTION STATUS FILE DESCRIPTION FOR MORE INFORMATION.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the admission date for the episode of CHAMPVA care being billed.

                                This cross-reference is used in conjunction with the ACVA cross reference on the PATIENT (#.02) field to cross reference all CHAMPVA inpatient subsistence charges by patient and admission date.

              LAST EDITED:      MAY 13, 1997 
              DESCRIPTION:      This date is used to determine when the patient charge (Status = ON HOLD) should be auto-released to Accounts Receivable as well as to generate reports.  The date is set initially when the patient charge is established and
                                placed on hold.  The date is reset when a third party claim for the same episode of care is authorized. The new ON HOLD DATE is the authorized date of the third party claim.

                                Cross-reference of all IB ACTIONS that have ever had the STATUS (#.05) of ON HOLD since the install of patch IB*2*70.  This cross-reference is used to automatically release charges ON HOLD for greater than 90 days. This 
                                cross reference is also used to generate both follow-up and historic reports.  The 'AHDT1' cross-reference on the STATUS (#.05) field is the companion to this cross-reference.
