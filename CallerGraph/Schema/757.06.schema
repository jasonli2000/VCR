This file provides feedback from the sites regarding the content of the Lexicon.  This is done either by a user through a calling application (user unresolved narratives) or by the calling application (application unresolved narratives).  USER UNRESOLVED
NARRATIVES occur when the user searches the Lexicon and fails to find a suitable expression in the Expression file (#757.01).  If the user select to use his/her original text, then user's input is temporarily stored in this file.  However, for a User
Unresolved Narrative to be stored, the calling application must be defined in the Subset Definition file (757.2) and have the Unresolved Narrative flag set to 1.  APPLICATION UNRESOLVED NARRATIVE occur when an application detects a problem with an
expression in the Expression file (757.01).  The application can return the Internal Entry Number (IEN) of that expression along with a short comment stating the problem. Periodically the entries in this file will be packed up into a mail message and
sent to G.LEXICON@ISC-SLC.VA.GOV for consideration for possible inclusion in the Lexicon.  After the mail message is sent the entries in this file are deleted.  NOTE:  This file is exported without data.
