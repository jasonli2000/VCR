This file is basically a dictionary of abbreviated codes or notations which are used in the laboratory repeatedly.  Each one of the 'canned' codes will expand to a full-length message whenever the code is typed in at a 'Select COMMENT:' prompt.  Using
these codes proves to be a great time-saver for lab users, and is especially helpful to the microbiology package (notorious for long,long names of bacteria and numerous comments on culture results).  The Blood Bank and Anatomic Pathology modules use this
file extensively as well.
