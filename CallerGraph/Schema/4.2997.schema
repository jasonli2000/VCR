              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3-30 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used by a routine (or server) that automatically enters names into this file to mark it with a prechosen name.  This name must be coordinated by the MailMan Development team.  Local sites may use names that
                                begin with the three character sequence "XMZ" without coordinating.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 20, 1993 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3-30 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to address mail automatically.  When a look-up is done on the local user file and fails, a secondary look-up tries to find the user in the Remote User file.  If it is found, the message is automatically
                                addressed using this field.  

              CROSS-REFERENCE:  4.2997^F

                                2)= K ^XMD(4.2997,"F",X,DA)
                                This cross reference is used for look-up and also to determine if an entry already exists.  Theory is that the old and new addresses can exist in the file and that is okay.  The bad entry will be removed when the user 
                                notifies the support staff.
