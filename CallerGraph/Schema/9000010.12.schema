This file has been designed for joint use by the Indian Health Service and the Department of Veteran Affairs. There will be one record for each type of skin test given to a patient on a given visit.  Data must exist for a patient and a visit before data
can be entered here.  The record is normally created when a skin test is given, and the results, if available, are entered at a later date and matched to the original record.  If results are entered and a skin test given does not exist, a new record is 
created.  
 
In the VA, If a CPT code is entered into PCE that represents a skin test, then a skin test entry will automatically be entered into the V Skin Test file.  And vice versa, if a skin test is entered into PCE that represents a CPT code, then a CPT entry
will automatically be entered into the V CPT file.  This supports getting workload credit from clinical activities.  The PCE Code Mapping file defines the relationships between Skin Tests and CPT codes.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the date and time the skin test was done. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the date and time the skin test was performed.  This date and time may be different from the visit date and time.  For example, for clinic appointment visits, the visit date and time is the date and time of the
                                appointment, not the time the provider performed the clinical event.  
                                 
                                The date may be an imprecise date.  
                                 
                                Date and time may be within 30 days before or after the visit date, with the restriction the date cannot be a future date.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE User Interface, which allows manual entry of data, will be the primary source of the event date and time.  The event date prompt defaults to the visit date and the time is entered to reflect the actual time the
                                skin test was done. The event date does not have to be the visit date, but it must be within 30 days before or after the visit, and not be a future date.  
                                 
                                If a user wants to enter an historical skin test, the user should use the Historical Encounter entry action to document the historical skin test. Historical entries will not be eligible for workload credit.  
                                 
                                PCE data sources for automatic (scanning) data capture will be blank unless the event date and time are passed to PCE for filing.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE filing logic requires a pointer to the PCE data source file.  If this is not passed, then PCE filing logic will not process the data.  
                                 
                                If the record is a new record, then an "A" is used to specify the source that added the data.  If the record existed previously, PCE filing logic compares the old and new records of information.  An "E" will be
                                automatically used if the filing logic finds the data has been edited.  If "E" is used, then the Edited Flag field is automatically set to 1.  
                                 
                                The DUZ is stored in its internal format to represent the user who performed the adding or editing of data for this record.
