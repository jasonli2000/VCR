This file is used to store insurers' details data returned by Integrated Billing package to be used by ECME engine to build claim requests and reversals and send them to insurers (payers).  Generally there should be few or no entries in this file unless
there are stranded claims, reversal or requests that need to be un-stranded by the user.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the numeric identifier for the record (1- 99999999999999, 5 Decimal Digits). 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a numeric identifier that follows the same format as the IEN of the BPS TRANSACTION (#9002313.59) file. For billing requests and reversals, this is the Prescription IEN, followed by a decimal point, followed by the
                                Fill Number left-padded with zeros up to four places and then followed by the COB indicator (1-Primary, 2-Secondary, 3-Tertiary).  For a Eligibility Verification request, this is the Patient IEN, followed by a decimal
                                point, followed by the Policy Number (with 9000 added to it) and then followed by 1.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  At the point that the BPS INSURER DATA record is created, the BPS TRANSACTION record may not be defined so this field uses the same format but cannot be a pointer.  The value for this field is created by calling
                                IEN^BPSOSRX, which is the same call that is done to determine the IEN of the BPS transaction file.  Since the code that creates the value for this field and the code that calculates the IEN of the BPS Transaction field use
                                the same API (and parameters), they both will have the same value and thus, the data does not need to be updated when the BPS Transaction record is created (it is already correct).
