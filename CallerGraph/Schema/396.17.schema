This file holds the definitions generated by users of the CAPRI C&P Worksheet Module (CPWM) that are used to re-generate GUI screens.  CPWM allows point-n-click entry of C&P examinations and will store ASCII reports in AMIE and TIU when the user has
finished the documentation process.  This file serves to track documents in progress as well as documents that have been already completed and sent to TIU and AMIE.

              DESCRIPTION:      Once a form has been opened in the GUI, this field will be populated with identifying information - user DUZ^date/time file was opened.  It will be left in edit mode in the GUI fileman components until the user exits.  The
                                data will then be cleared and the field exited on the GUI side. If the application is terminated prematurely, the lock is automatically dropped.  
                                 
                                By leaving the field in edit mode throughout the session, until the user closes their template, other CAPRI instances will be able to tell that someone is using the record and prevent other users from changing the data
                                until the first user exits.
