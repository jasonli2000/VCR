              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the census date as established by VACO.  
                                 
                                It is used in various census options and reports.  Its most important use is to determine who needs census transactions sent to Austin.  All inpatients as of 11:59pm of the census date are listed in the Census Status
                                Report as needing a transaction.  
                                 
                                This date is usually the last date of the quarter, such as 12/31/2000.  
                                 
                                Please note, you are not allowed to enter a census date greater then the last day of the quarter.

              LAST EDITED:      APR 14, 1990 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the date PTF records can be transmitted for patients who also have census records for this census year.  
                                 
                                Note: Discharges that have admission dates after the census date 
                                      are not affected by this parameter.  PTF records for these 
                                      admissions can be transmitted in the usual manner.  
                                 
                                This date is determined by VACO and should only be changed as directed by VACO.  
                                 
                                If PTF transactions are transmitted to Austin before this date, the PTF transaction would overlay census transactions for the admission.  
                                 
                                It is possible to close and release PTF transactions. However, the software will not allow the transmission of these PTF transactions before this OK TO XMIT PTF TRANSACTIONS date.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates if this census date entry is the currently active census.  There can only be one census date active at any one point in time.  It is possible not to have any census date active.  
                                 
                                The software enforces this 'only one active' rule.  If a user attempts to have more than one census date active, s/he will get an error message indicating the census date that is currently active.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the first date of the census period.  All specialty movements and procedures that occurred for the inpatient from this date, CENSUS PERIOD START DATE, to the census date should be reported to Austin for

                                The software uses this date when creating the census record from the PTF record.  Only those movements and procedures that occurred during that time frame are copied.  
                                 
                                This date is usually the first day of a Fiscal Year, such as 10/1/94 for the 9/30/95 census.
