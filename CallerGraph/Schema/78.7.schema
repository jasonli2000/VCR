              HELP-PROMPT:      This is a local variable name associated with this print field. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the MUMPS local variable name that this print field will be associated with when the print format is used by the system.  It is assigned by the developer and must be between 1 and 8 characters in length.

              LAST EDITED:      MAY 03, 1996 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Is this field shared among cases that belong to the same print set 
              DESCRIPTION:      When this field is printed in a report, and the report is a combined report of several cases that belong to the same report, then this field value will be trailed by a '+'.  The purpose of this character is to give the
                                user a visual cue that there is additional data that cannot be printed within the space confines of a label or report header or footer.  For example, print sets include several different procedures but not all of them will
                                fit on a report header or a label, so a single procedure name is printed with a '+' to indicate that there are more procedures in the print set.

              HELP-PROMPT:      This is the MUMPS code to set the internal variable to a value. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the MUMPS code that sets the 'Internal Variable' to the appropriate value.  It is executed when this print field is used to print the appropriate data and is between 1 and 240 characters in length.
