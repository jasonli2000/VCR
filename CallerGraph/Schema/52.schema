Contains all outpatient RX data used by the outpatient pharmacy package.  As the above indicates, this is the hub of the outpatient system.  It will easily be the largest pharmacy file in time and is pointed to very heavily.  Deletion of an entry in this
file must be handled VERY carefully and is not allowed if refills have been issued.  
 
Of particular interest is that essentially all the history pertaining to a particular Rx is contained in each Rx entry.
