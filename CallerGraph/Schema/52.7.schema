  The IV SOLUTIONS file contains drugs which will be used as the primary solutions in the IV room.  Any drug entered in this file must already exist in the DRUG file (50).  All drug information relating to its use in the IV package is stored in the IV
SOLUTIONS file.  If a drug is no longer to be used as an IV solution, DO NOT delete it from the IV SOLUTIONS file, but simply inactivate it by entering the date it is to be discontinued in the INACTIVATION DATE field.
