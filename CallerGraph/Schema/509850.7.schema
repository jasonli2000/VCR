                DESCRIPTION:      The UNIQUE field contains a count of the ICD-9CM disease codes by unique (capitated) patient.  A unique (capitated) visit is one for which no ASP visit is on record for the current fiscal year.  This field is important
                                  because future budget allocations in VHA will be based on unique visits (i.e., fixed, per capita rates for each patient without regard to the number or nature of  services provided).  However, it is important to
                                  understand that a unique visit for the ASP service may not be unique to the medical center.  ASP services may be asked for the proportion of unique patients in the case mix as medical centers and VISNs improve
                                  efficiency.  The user may compare the total COUNT to the UNIQUE count to determine the case mix.

                DESCRIPTION:      The UNIQUE field contains a count of the CPT-4 procedure codes by unique (capitated) patient.  A unique (capitated) visit is one for which no ASP visit is on record for the current fiscal year.  This field is important
                                  because future budget allocations in VHA will be based on unique visits (i.e., fixed, per capita rates for each patient without regard to the number or nature of  services provided).  However, it is important to
                                  understand that a unique visit for the ASP service may not be unique to the medical center.  ASP services may be asked for the proportion of unique patients in the case mix as medical centers and VISNs improve

                DESCRIPTION:      The PERCENT field contains the workload percentage for each CDR account.  QUASAR uses the following algorithm to calculate cost distributions.  You specify the TOTAL PAID HOURS and any PASS-THROUGH ACCOUNTS (i.e., 6000-,
                                  7000-, and 8000-series accounts).  You must also enter administrative time associated with Associated Health Professions Traineeship or other VA Headquarters-sponsored training programs (.13 subaccount) and time
                                  associated with preparing and presenting formal continuing education programs (.14 subaccount).  You must enter any medical (.21 subaccount) or prosthetics (.22 subaccount) research hours.  QUASAR calculates hours for
                                  instruction/supervision of trainees (.12 subaccount).  QUASAR computes the total education, research, and pass-through hours and subtracts this total from the total paid hours.  The remainder is the number of hours for
                                  patient care during the reporting period.  QUASAR then computes the proportion of care associated with specific cost accounts (based on treating specialty) to the total number of hours of patient care.

                                          Quasar calculates hours for instruction/ supervision of trainees (.12 subaccount).  Quasar computes the total education, research and pass-through hours and subtracts this total from the total paid hours. The
                                          remainder is the number of hours for patient care during the reporting period. Quasar then computes the proportion of care associated with specific cost accounts (based on treating specialty) to the total number
                                          of hours of patient care.
