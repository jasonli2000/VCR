                HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-10 characters in length. 
                DESCRIPTION:      Order number can be in one of three forms.  All order numbers are numbers appended with a unique type identifier.  The expected formats include: 
                                   
                                    nP : a 'P' indicates that the order is PENDING action by Pharmacy 
                                         Service.  (Given that the BCMA Backup System is designed to be 
                                         real-time, pending orders are transmitted and stored on the 
                                         BCMA Backup System workstation.  
                                   
                                    nU : a 'U' indicates that the order is for a UNIT DOSE medication.  
                                   
                                    nV : a 'V' indicates that the order is for INTRAVENOUS medication -- 
                                         that is, IV solutions and additives.  
                                   
                                  Order numbers are filed in this file with their respective alpha characters because unit dose and IV orders could have the same numeric portion of an order number.  
                                   
                                  It also should be noted that 'P'ENDING order numbers are completely replaced once the order has been processed by Pharmacy on the VistA server.  Once Pharmacy processes the order, an actual order number (that is, one
                                  with either a 'U' or a 'V' appended to it) is generated and filed on the workstation.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) order number associated with this Pharmacy order.  This field is of particular importance in the case of 'P'ending orders.  Whenever an order is processed
                                  into a patient's BCMA Backup System record a check is made whether the CPRS order is already on file, and further whether that order on file is 'P'ending.  If so, the 'P'ending order record is deleted and replaced by the
                                  data transmitted in the new HL7 message.
