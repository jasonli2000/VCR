This file contains the Lower Layer Protocol Parameters used by the HL7 package. Each protocol will use a separate node to hold the parameters associated will the LLP used by the Logical Link. The currently defined nodes are: 
 
100 - MailMan 200 - HLLP 300 - X3.28 
 
There may be redundant information contained on nodes, the goal was to allow the applications to grap a one node for all the parameters required.  There should be an entry in this file for each Logical Link defined in file (#870). There is an x-ref
"ALLP" defined for file (#870) to facilitate navigation from this file.

                                  single M process to do the listening.

                                  Designates that the current system is a server (listener), creating

              LAST EDITED:      AUG 20, 1998 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter 'YES' if this connection needs to remain open even if there are no messages to send.  The connection will remain open until it is disconnected by either side via shutting-down the logical link.  A setting of 'YES' is
                                appropriate for connecting to a COTS device with a high volume of messages.

              DESCRIPTION:      Retention is the maximum time in seconds in which a non-persistent LLP will wait after the associated queue has been emptied.  If further messages arrive in the queue before the retention time has expired, the LLP will
                                continue to dequeue and send messages.  Otherwise, the LLP will become inactive and will remain inactive until further messages are queued.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the Taskman node to start this LLP on. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is ONLY for VMS sites running Dual Taskman in DCL.  
                                 
                                This field is used to specify what Taskman node you want to job the Lower Level Protocol.  It should only be used if you have two Taskmans running and only want the LLP to run on a particular node.  It will only work if
                                you are running the dual Taskmans in DCL context on a VMS system.
