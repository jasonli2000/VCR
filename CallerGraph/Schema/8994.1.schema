              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains all the information that the Broker needs to run a background process, which accepts incoming connection requests.  The listener doesn't execute the client's RPCs.  The listener starts up other
                                processes as handlers, which run RPCs.

8994.17,1       PORT                   1;0 Multiple #8994.171

                DESCRIPTION:      This is the TCP/IP port that the listener should monitor for incoming connection requests.  This is the port which a client should use to connect to a server.  
                                   
                                  Don't use a port that is already in use on the CPU where you want to run the listener.  No two processes can share the same TCP/IP port on the same CPU.  
                                   
                                  Typically, port numbers bellow 5000 are reserved for various common TCP/IP services.  So you should use port numbers 9000 and above.

                                    This is a flag to tell a Cache/NT site what kind of RPCBroker listener to start.  It should not be needed for other types of RPCBroker listeners because they will be under the control of TCPIP service.

                  DESCRIPTION:      If you want the Broker listener to start listening on this CPU-port-UCI when the XWB LISTENER STARTER option is run, enter YES.  All of the listener entries in this file that have CONTROLLED BY LISTENER STARTER set to
                                    YES will be started when XWB LISTENER STARTER option is run.  
                                     
                                    Hint: XWB LISTENER STARTER option may be used to start all of the listeners 
                                          you need automatically when the Task Manager is started.  Use the 
                                          Schedule/Unschedule Options option.  In the SPECIAL QUEUEING field 
                                          enter STARTUP.  Leave all other fields empty.
