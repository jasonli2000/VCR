              DESCRIPTION:      This field does not affect transmissions necessary for enrollment updates.  
                                 
                                This field will be updated automatically by the DHCP IVM software module.  If it contains a 0 or is null, whenever changes are made to the means test or demographic information for this patient, a new transmission will be
                                sent.  
                                 
                                If the field equals 1, it means that further transmissions should not be sent to the IVM Center unless requested via a query.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field does not affect transmissions necessary for enrollment purposes.  
                                 
                                This field is set by the module only.  The value 0 is equivelant to a null response and means that demographic or means test changes will be transmitted to the IVM Center.  
                                 
                                A value of 1 means that no futher transmissions for this patient should be made.  The value of 1 could be put into this field in one of four circumstance: 
                                   1.  The patient's means test or insurance status changes such that 
                                       the patient no longer meets the IVM criteria for the year in 
                                       question.  In this case, one last transmission will be sent to 
                                       the IVM Center and then the flag will be set to 1 to stop future 
                                       transmissions.  
                                 
                                   2.  The IVM Center sends a case status of 1 indicating that the case 
                                       will no longer be looked at by IVM personnel.  
                                 
                                   3.  The IVM Center sends a verified Means Test back to the Medical 
                                       Center.  This action officially closes the case.  
                                 
                                   4.  DHCP users reject the suggested SSN for the veteran (in the 
                                       SSN Upload) which has been sent to the Medical Center from IVM.  
                                       The case is closed because IVM cannot pursue the case until 
                                       it can match the patient with the Social Security Administration.

              DESCRIPTION:      If a case record has been closed, this field is used to store the source which was responsible for closing the record.  If the IVM Center is not going to verify a Means Test, they will send a CASE STATUS messaage to DHCP
                                in order to close the case.  In this case IVM will be the source of the closure.  They will also be the closure source when they transmit a verified Means Test to DHCP.  
                                 
                                If a veteran's Means Test no longer meets the IVM criteria, then DHCP will serve as the closure source.  Case records will also be closed when a recommended SSN for a veteran which is transmitted to DHCP from IVM is
                                rejected in the SSN Upload.  
                                 
                                Note that a closed case may be re-opened if the IVM Center sends an individual query message to DHCP for a specific case.
