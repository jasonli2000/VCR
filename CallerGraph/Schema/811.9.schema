              DESCRIPTION:      This field is the name of a clinical reminder definition. Nationally distributed reminder definition names are prefixed with "VA-". The VA- prefixed reminder definitions cannot be altered by a site, but may be inactivated
                                so they will not be selectable or evaluated in the CPRS GUI.  
                                 
                                Local modifications can be made to any "VA-" reminder definition by copying the definition to a new one with a unique name and then making modifications to the new definition which meet local criteria.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                National reminders names will start with VA- and they will have a class of National. National reminders cannot be edited by sites.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to let a reminder become due earlier than the date determined by adding the frequency to the date when the reminder was last resolved. For example, if the frequency is 1Y (one year) and the DO IN ADVANCE
                                TIME FRAME is 1M (one month), the reminder would have a status of "DUE SOON" 11 months after it was last resolved. After one year has passed, the STATUS would be "DUE".  
                                 
                                Frequencies have the form IU where I is an integer and U is one of the following units: H (hours), D (days), W (weeks), M (months), and Y (years).

                                Other applications that use reminders may use this flag to determine if a reminder can be selected for inclusion.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  When a reminder is inactive, the following will occur: 1. It cannot be selected for inclusion on a Health Summary. (Other packages that use Reminders should follow this rule.) 2. In the Clinical Maintenance mode, a message
                                will be returned stating the reminder is inactive along with the date and time when it was made inactive.  3. In any other mode, nothing will be returned.

              DESCRIPTION:      This multiple is for defining reminder frequency age ranges sets. It can be used to specify different frequencies for different ages. For example, you could define a frequency of every 3 years for ages 40 to 49 as the
                                first age range set, a frequency of every 2 years for ages 50 to 59 as the second, and a frequency of once a year for ages 60 to 75. With this set the reminder would be due every 3 years for ages 40 to 49, every 2 years
                                for ages 50 to 59, and once a year for ages 60 to 75.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to rank the frequency and age range sets associated with a finding. If there is more than one true finding that can override the baseline frequency age range set, then the determination of which one to
                                  use is made based on the finding with the highest rank.  Ranks can range from 1 to 999 with 1 being the highest rank.

                                  applicable to the patient. If the cohort logic evaluates to false, then reminder is non-applicable or N/A.

                DESCRIPTION:      This is the beginning date/time to search for the finding. When combined with the ENDING DATE/TIME, they define a date range in which to search for the finding.  
                                   
                                  This can be entered in any of the acceptable FileMan date/time formats and abbreviations. See the FileMan Getting Started Manual to learn about acceptable FileMan date/time formats and abbreviations.

                                  and N is an occurrence may also be used. For example, FIEVAL(M,"DATE")-3M would set the Beginning Date/Time to the date of finding M minus three months. Note that when this form is used and finding M is false no
                                  Beginning Date/Time can be determined so this finding will be set to false.  
                                   
                                  If this field is null, then the beginning date/time will correspond with the  date/time of the oldest entry in the patient's record.

                DESCRIPTION:      Normally only active problems from the Problem List will be used in the reminder evaluation. If USE INACTIVE PROBLEMS is set to YES then both active and inactive problems will be used. Note that this field applies only
                                  to taxonomy findings.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field applies only to health factors. In order to understand how it works, you need to understand how health factors work in the reminder evaluation process. If you are not clear about this, see the health factor
                                  section of the Clinical Reminder Manager Manual.  
                                   
                                  The default behavior is to use only the most recent health factor within a category. A problem can arise if there are two or more health factors within a category and they both have the same date.  (This can happen if
                                  both health factors are given during the same encounter).  When the dates are the same, the health factor with the highest WITHIN CATEGORY RANK will be used. This is a numerical value like RANK FREQUENCY, with 1 being
                                  the highest rank.  
                                   
                                  If WITHIN CATEGORY RANK has the special value of 0, then the categorization of health factors will be ignored and the health factor will be treated as a distinct finding.

                DESCRIPTION:      This is the ending date/time to search for findings. When combined with the BEGINNING DATE/TIME they define a date range in which to search for the finding. The ENDING DATE/TIME must be after the BEGINNING DATE/TIME.  
                                   
                                  This can be entered in any of the acceptable FileMan date/time formats and abbreviations. See the FileMan Getting Started Manual to learn about acceptable FileMan date/time formats and abbreviations.

                                  and N is an occurrence may also be used. For example, FIEVAL(M,"DATE")+3M would set the Ending Date/Time to the date of finding M plus three months. Note that when this form is used and finding M is false no Ending
                                  Date/Time can be determined so this finding will be set to false.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3-225 characters in length. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The CONDITION must be written in M code based on the value returned from the patient results for the finding. Each type of finding has a specific field that provides the value available to use in the CONDITION logic.  If
                                  the finding value is text, enclose the condition value in quotes (e.g., "positive"). If the finding value is numeric, do not use quotes (e.g., 3).  
                                   
                                  An IF statement is used to evaluate the value.  The value is always identified as V in the statement regardless of the type of finding. If the condition logic statement evaluates to true, the finding is considered as
                                  found (true); otherwise the finding is considered as not found (false).  
                                   
                                  Relational operators that may be used include: = equals, < less than, > greater than, [ contains, ] follows and ? pattern matches. Logical operators may be used to check multiple values: & And, ! Or, ' Not. 
                                           
                                  Typical examples of M code are as follows: 
                                      I V=3 for Education Topic's Level of Understanding = 3 
                                      I V="H" for Health Factor's Level/Severity="H"

                                      systolic and diastolic values 
                                      I ($P(V,"/",1)>140)!($P(V,"/",2)>90) for elevated blood pressure 
                                      systolic or diastolic values

                                    have certain possible statuses assigned to it. The editors will evaluate the finding items and allow the users to only  select a status from an appropriate list of statuses for that finding item.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 31, 2003 
              DESCRIPTION:      This multiple is used to define function findings; each function finding is labeled by an integer: the FUNCTION FINDING NUMBER. The user defines a function finding by inputting a FUNCTION FINDING NUMBER and associated
                                FUNCTION STRING. Function Findings are then used in the reminder definition logic by reference to FF(FUNCTION FINDING NUMBER). For example, if function findings 1 and 2 were defined, then they could be used in the cohort
                                or resolution logic as FF(1) and FF(2).  
                                 
                                Function findings can be used in the resolution logic with one caveat. They do not have a date associated with them; therefore, the resolution logic must be written so that it cannot be made true solely by a function
                                finding.

                    DESCRIPTION:      This optional field is used to indicate that this finding item should be included as part of the Patient Cohort Logic for this reminder. Note - if the CUSTOMIZED COHORT LOGIC is defined, then this field is ignored.  
                                       
                                      Valid entries for the USE IN PATIENT COHORT LOGIC field are:

                                                            (Use @ to delete value) 
                                         &        AND       &(Finding) 
                                         !        OR        !(Finding)

                                      All finding items that have a value in this field are automatically combined to create the DEFAULT COHORT LOGIC. The default logic string initially includes (SEX)&(AGE), regardless of whether the baseline specifies
                                      SEX and AGE criteria. Each finding item with a value in the Use In Patient Cohort Logic field is appended to the string by using the operator and finding item. For example, if finding item 2 had an operator for this
                                      field of "&" then the string would be (SEX)&(AGE)&FI(2).  
                                       
                                      After all findings have been evaluated, the finding item is replaced by its true or false value in the cohort logic and the cohort logic is evaluated. If the cohort logic evaluates to true, then the reminder is
                                      applicable to the patient. If the cohort logic evaluates to false then reminder is non-applicable or N/A.

              DESCRIPTION:      When a CUSTOM DATE DUE is defined, it takes precedence over the standard date due calculation. This means the normal date due calculation that is based on the dates of the resolution findings and the final frequency is not
                                done. Only the dates of the findings and the frequencies specified in the Custom Date Due string are used. Any finding that is in the reminder definition can be used in the Custom Date Due string; it is not limited to
                                those defined as resolution findings.  
                                 
                                The final age range will still be used to determine if the patient is in the cohort; however, the frequency associated with this age range is not used. Only the frequencies specified in the Custom Date Due String are used.
                                They are added to the date of the associated finding to determine the dates used by either the MIN_DATE or MAX_DATE functions.

      Short Descr:  Set the E and EDEP indexes.
      Description:  This cross-reference is used to group findings for evaluation. It creates two indexes, the first one has the form: 
                     
                     ^PXD(811.9,DA(1),20,"E",GLOBAL,IEN,DA) 
                     where 
                      DA(1) is the internal entry number in file # 811.9.  
                      GLOBAL is the global name of the global that defines the finding.  
                       For example, the global name for file #811.9 is ^PXD(811.9,.  
                      IEN is the internal entry number of the finding in GLOBAL.  
                      DA is the finding number.  
                     
                    Some examples: 
                     ^PXD(811.9,661,20,"E","PSDRUG(",6344,2)=

                    The second one has the form: 
                     ^PXD(811.9,DA(1),20,"EDEP",EO,GLOBAL,IEN,DA)=FBDT^FEDT where EO is the evaluation order, FBDT is the finding whose date is used to set the Beginning Date/Time for this finding, and FEDT is the finding whose date is used to set the
                    Ending Date/Time for this finding. Some examples: 
                     
                    ^PXD(811.9,406,20,"EDEP",1,"PXRMD(811.5,",811,2)=^1 ^PXD(811.9,406,20,"EDEP",2,"AUTTHF(",660161,3)=1^ 
                     
                    The "E" index groups findings that have no dependencies on other findings by type, findings in this index are evaluated first. The "EDEP" index orders findings whose date range depends on the date of other findings to ensure that the
                    finding(s) it depends on have been evaluated before it is evaluated.
