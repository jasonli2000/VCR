This file contains Supply Items and Order Units used in matching uploaded Prime Vendor invoice data.  
 
The user inputs the name of a supply item and the item's corresponding Vendor Stock Number (VSN). When an item is uploaded from the vendor, the Drug Accountability software attempts to identify the item by the NDC.  If a match cannot be found, the
entries in this file will be checked.  By storing the supply items, the user does not have to identify the item on the invoice as a supply item each time it is uploaded. 
 
The Prime Vendor ships drugs in a variety of order unit sizes. In some instances, the order unit on a invoiced item does not match the order unit in the facility's files. When this occurs the user has to perform a manual match on the item.  
 
By entering the order unit sent by the Prime Vendor to the order unit in VISTA, the matching can be performed automatically during the upload process.

                DESCRIPTION:       This multiple contains a list of items transported from the Prime Vendor 
                                   to VISTA as supply items. This field has a corresponding entry in the 
                                   VSN field. During uploading/processing of invoices, line items uploaded 
                                   from the invoice are compared against the values stored here. By matching 
                                   these items automatically, the processing time is greatly reduced.

                DESCRIPTION:       This Vendor Stock Number (VSN) is matched to the Supply Item field. During 
                                   the upload/processing of invoice data, if an item cannot be located in 
                                   VISTA according to the NDC, this field is checked for a match. This 
                                   automatic matching of items greatly decreases the amount of time needed 
                                   to process invoices.

                                   invoices transmitted to VISTA. Because of the large number of order 
                                   units available to the Prime Vendor, conversions need to be performed 
                                   to successfully process invoices.
