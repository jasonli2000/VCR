              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a name for the line that will allow it to be identified, such as V(1,1), meaning a vertical line starting at coordinates (1,1). 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                 The name given to the line. Lines should be given names that will allow them to be identified, such as V(1,1), meaning a vertical line starting at coordinates (1,1).

              DESCRIPTION:
                                 The column, relative to the block, that the line should begin at.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The internal representation starts at 0, the external representation starts at 1. The difference is because for computing the form image it is convenient to work with displacements from the top left-hand corner. However,
                                users do not want to work with row=0 or column=0.
