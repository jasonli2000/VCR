This file has been designed for joint use by the Indian Health Service and the Department of Veteran Affairs.  
 
In IHS, this record, along with a purpose of visit, is required for each patient encounter at a facility, or at a visit in the home or other field location.  This same requirement does not exist in the VA.  
 
Data must exist in both the Patient/IHS file and the Visit file before data can be entered here.  There can be multiple providers for a given visit. The primary/secondary field identifies which provider is considered the primary provider for this visit.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the date and time the provider had the encounter with the patient. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the date and time the provider had the encounter with the patient. This date and time may be different from the visit date and time.  For example, for clinic appointment visits, the visit date and time is the date 
                                and time of the appointment, not the time the provider performed the clinical event. 
                                 
                                The date may be an imprecise date.   
                                                            
                                Date and time may be within 30 days before or after the visit date, with the restriction the date cannot be a future date.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE User Interface, which allows manual entry of data, will be the primary source of the event date and time.  The event date prompt defaults to the visit date, and the time is entered to reflect the actual time the 
                                provider had the encounter.  The event date does not have to be the visit date, but it must be within 30 days before or after the visit, and not be a future date.  
                                 
                                If a user wants to enter a historical provider encounter, the user should use the Historical Encounter entry action to document the historical encounter with the provider. Historical entries will not be eligible for 
                                credit.  
                                 
                                PCE Data Sources for automatic (scanning) data capture will be blank unless the event date and time are passed to PCE for filing.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is populated automatically by the PCE filing logic.  The formt of the field is as follows:  Pointer to PCE data source file_"-"_A for Add or E for Edit_"-"DUZ of the persion who entered the data_";"...  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE filing logic requires a pointer to the PCE data source file.  If this is not passed, then PCE filing logic will not process the data.  
                                 
                                If the record is a new record, then an "A" is used to specify the source that added the data.  If the record existed previously, PCE filing logic compares the old and new records of information.  An "E" will be
                                automatically used if the filing logic finds the data has been edited.  If "E" is used, then the Edited Flag field is automatically set to 1.  
                                 
                                The DUZ is stored in its internal format to represent the user who performed the addition or editing of data for this record.  
                                 
                                Iterations of editing will be concatenated to the previous data source value, up to 85 characters.
