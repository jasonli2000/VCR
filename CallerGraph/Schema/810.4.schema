This file is used to define what extract criteria should be used to build reminder patient lists. Extract criteria is defined as "list rules" in this file. The file is used by the Reminder Patient List option and Reminder Extract Management option to
create patient lists. 
 
There are four types of rule criteria in the List Rule file: 
 
  Patient List - defines an existing patient list 
  Finding Rule  - defines reminder terms that specify findings 
                  and the date ranges to use 
  Reminder Rule - defines a reminder definition that builds a patient list 
                  based on the patient cohort logic using the ending date as 
                  the evaluation date. 
  Rule Set      - defines a multiple of sequentially defined list rules 
                  (a rule set can not be included in the multiple). 
 
The rule criteria are combined into a Rule Set that defines how to use the criteria to create or modify a patient list. Rule Sets allow lists of patients to be manipulated when a patient meets specified criteria by the following operations: 
 
  ADD     to a new or existing patient list 
  REMOVE   from an existing list 
  SELECT   retain a patient in an existing list if the patient meets the 
           criteria, and remove the patient if the patient does not meet 
           the criteria. 
  
A rule set can contain multiple operations. One operation can be defined for each sequence in the rule set.  
 
Nationally distributed list rules are prefixed with 'VA-' and cannot be modified by sites.  
 
FINDING RULES and Date Ranges: 
------------------------------------------------------------
A Date Range is used by FINDING RULES to search for findings.  List build processing determines which Beginning Date/time and Ending Date/time to use when evaluating each finding based on where the date/times are defined.  Beginning Date/Time (BDT) and
Ending Date/Time (EDT) fields can be defined at multiple levels: 
 
1  List Build action BDT and EDT: default when not defined at lower level 
  2  Rule Set Sequence BDT and EDT: overrides previous level 
    3  List Rule BDT and EDT: overrides previous levels 
      4  Term Finding BDT and EDT: overrides previous levels 
 
This override relationship can be defined with the following equation, where "<" should be interpreted as "is overridden by": 
 
List Build < rule set sequence < list rule < term's finding 
 
List Build and date range evaluation: 
------------------------------------
 
The List Build BDT and EDT are specified by the user selecting the List Build action. The List Build BDT and EDT is the default date range when the BDT and EDT are not defined for the rule set sequence, list rule, or term finding. The default date range
is used to find a match on each finding in the criteria. 
 
If no date range limits should be used to find a match on finding, either the rule set sequence or list rule needs to be defined with a zero in the BDT or EDT fields, or both. A zero in the BDT field means start with the patient's oldest data. A zero in
the EDT field represents the end of the day on the day the list is built. Note: This is in contrast to Reminder Definitions, where the BDT and EDT for a finding are left blank to specify no limits. In the REMINDER LIST RULE file, if zero is defined in
the BDT, and the EDT is left blank, the list build tools will assume both BDT and EDT should not have date range limits, and vice versa if EDT has the 0 and the BDT is blank. 
 
The use of "T" in the BDT or EDT fields always represents the List Build ending date/time specified for the list build action or the extract reporting period, depending on whether a reminder patient list or extract option is being used to build the list.  
 
"BDT" may also be used in the BDT or EDT fields and represents the starting date/time specified for the list build process or the extract reporting period.  BDT-5Y creates a date five years prior to the beginning date/time. 
 
If the ending date/time is earlier than the beginning date/time, then no finding matches will be found.  
 
REMINDER RULES and Date Ranges: 
------------------------------------------------------------
Reminder Rules do not use the Beginning Date/time from the List Build, List Rule Sequence or Reminder Rule Beginning Date/time fields. Reminder evaluation using date ranges is based on existing reminder definitions. However, a Reminder Rule will use the
Ending Date/time (EDT) from the Reminder Rule, List Rule Sequence, or List Build EDT. The same EDT overrides that are used for Finding Rule EDT are also used for Reminder Rule. The EDT used for reminder evaluation can be defined at multiple levels: 1 
List Build action EDT: default when not defined at lower level 
  2  Rule Set Sequence EDT: overrides previous level 
    3  List Rule EDT: overrides previous levels 
      4  Reminder evaluation is not impacted by terms in the reminder 
         definition.

                                This field is the beginning date/time (BDT) to use when searching for  findings that match a List Finding Rule. In order for patient data to meet the List Finding Rule criteria, the findings must have been documented on or
                                after the BDT.  
                                 
                                Reminder Rules and Patient List Rules do not use the Beginning date/time field. 
                                 
                                The BDT defined for a finding rule will be overridden if the term in the finding rule has a mapped finding with a BDT or Ending Date/Time (EDT).  
                                 
                                The rules for overriding date ranges is represented by the following equation, where "<" should be interpreted as "is overridden by": 
                                 
                                  Build < rule set sequence < list rule < term's finding 
                                 
                                If the BDT and EDT are not defined on the list rule set sequence, nor the list finding rule, nor the Reminder Term's mapped finding, then the patient list tools will use the List Build's date range to find a match on
                                findings. The List Build date range is the date range specified by the user when the list build action is selected. The list build date range is the Extract reporting period if an extract is being run.  
                                 
                                If no date range limits should be used to match findings for this finding rule, the finding rule needs to be defined with a zero in the BDT or EDT fields, or both. The term referenced in the list rule should not have BDT
                                and EDT fields defined. If zero is defined in the BDT, and the EDT is left blank, the list build tools will assume both BDT and EDT should not have date range limits, and vice versa if EDT has the 0 and the BDT is blank.  
                                 
                                The use of "T" in the finding rule BDT field will always represent the ending date/time specified for the list build process or the extract reporting period, depending on whether a reminder patient list or extract option
                                is being used to build the list. For example, T-1Y is one year prior to the list build's ending date/time.  
                                 
                                "BDT" may also be used in the BDT or EDT fields and represents the beginning date/time specified by the user processing the list build action. For example, BDT-5Y creates a beginning date for the list rule that is five
                                years prior to the list build's beginning date/time.  
                                 
                                A fixed date may be defined in the BDT (e.g. 09/11/02).  
                                 
                                If the beginning date/time is later than the ending date/time, then no finding matches will be found.

                                The Ending Date/Time (EDT) defined for this list rule will be overridden if the term in the list rule has a mapped finding with a Beginning Date/Time (BDT) or Ending Date/Time (EDT).  
                                 
                                If the BDT and EDT are not defined on the list rule, nor the rule set sequence, nor the Reminder Term's mapped finding, then the patient list tools will use the List Build date range to find a match on findings. The List
                                Build date range is the date range specified by the user when the list build action is selected. The list build date range is the Extract reporting period if an extract is being run.  
                                 
                                If no date range limits should be used to match findings for this list rule, the list rule needs to be defined with a zero in the BDT or EDT fields, or both. The term referenced in the list rule should not have BDT and EDT
                                fields defined. If zero is defined in the list rule BDT, and the EDT is left blank, the list build tools will assume both BDT and EDT should not have date range limits, and vice versa if EDT has the 0 and the BDT is blank.  
                                 
                                The use of "T" in the List rule EDT field will always represent the ending date/time specified for the list build process or the extract reporting period, depending on whether a reminder patient list or extract option is
                                being used to build the list. T-1Y is one year prior to the list build's ending date/time.  
                                 
                                "BDT" may also be used in the BDT or EDT fields and represents the beginning date/time specified by the user processing the list build action. For example "BDT-5Y" in the list rule beginning date, and "BDT" in the list
                                rule ending date will create a five year date range ending on the list build's beginning date/time.  
                                 
                                A fixed date may also be defined in the EDT (e.g. 09/11/02).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the name of the extract patient list defined in the extract definition. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a free-text field that contains the name of the patient list to use when processing this list rule during an extract run. The patient list has not been created at the time the list rule is defined. In contrast, the
                                USE EXISTING PT LIST field is used by patient list rule tools to reference a patient list already existing in the REMINDER PATIENT LIST file.  
                                 
                                The name specified in the USE EXTRACT PT LIST NAMED will contain 'yyyy' for year and 'pnn' for reporting period. The nn is either the month (01-12) or calendar quarter (01-04), and p is either M for monthly, Q for
                                quarterly, or Y for yearly.  
                                 
                                When an extract is run for a particular reporting period, the extract tool will use the USE EXTRACT PT LIST NAMED to find the patient list matching the name and then use this patient list to create the starting temporary
                                patient list. The starting temporary patient list will be modified by add, select, and delete operations defined in the remaining list rules defined in the rule set.  
                                 
                                The same extract patient list name is also named in the REMINDER EXTRACT DEFINITION file (#810.2). The extract definition is used to create the extract patient list during an extract run. The 'yyyy' and 'pnn' ensures the
                                extract process for the reporting year and period consistently uses the appropriate extract patient list created for the reporting period.  
                                 
                                Example: The patient list 'VA-*IHD QUERI yyyy pnn PATIENTS WITH QUALIFYING VISIT' is created during 'VA-IHD QUERI' extract processing by a rule set defined in the extract definition. Then a subsequent rule set defined in
                                the 'VA-IHD QUERI' extract definition references a REMINDER LIST RULE entry with the same extract patient list name in the USE EXTRACT PT LIST NAMED field.  During the extract run, the named list will be used to find the 
                                patient list created during the extract run in process.  This list is used with the ADD operation in the rule set to create the temporary patient list to process the remaining rules in the rule set. In this example, the
                                temorary patient list is  modified to include patients that have both a QUALIFYING VISIT and an ANCHOR visit, creating a new patient list, 'VA-*IHD QUERI yyyy nn PATIENTS WITH QUALIFYING AND ANCHOR VISIT'. The new patient
                                list created by the rule set processing is defined in the extract definition.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field is the beginning date/time (BDT) to use when searching for  findings that match the rule set sequence criteria.  In order for patient data to meet the rule set sequence criteria, the findings must have been
                                  documented on or after the beginning date/time.  
                                   
                                  The rules for overriding date ranges can be defined with the following equation, where "<" should be interpreted as "is overridden by": 
                                   
                                    List Build < rule set sequence < list rule < term's finding 
                                   
                                  The Beginning Date/Time (BDT) defined for a rule set sequence will be overridden if the finding list rule, or term in the finding list rule has a mapped finding with a Beginning Date/Time (BDT) or Ending Date/Time (EDT).  
                                   
                                  If the BDT and EDT are not defined on the rule set sequence, 
                                                         nor the list rule, 
                                                         nor the Reminder Term's mapped finding, then the patient list tools will use the List Build date range to find a match on findings. The List Build date range is the date range specified by the user
                                  when the list build action is selected.  The list build date range is the extract reporting period if an extract is being run.  
                                   
                                  If no date range limits should be used to match findings for this rule set sequence, the rule set sequence (or its list rule) needs to be defined with a zero in the BDT and/or EDT fields. The term referenced in the list
                                  rule should not have BDT and EDT fields defined. If zero is defined in the BDT, and the EDT is left blank, the list build tools will assume both BDT and EDT should not have date range limits, and vice versa if EDT has
                                  the 0 and the BDT is blank. Both BDT and EDT may be set to zero.  
                                   
                                  The use of "T" in the rule set sequence BDT field will always represent the ending date/time specified for the list build process or the extract reporting period, depending on whether a reminder patient list or extract
                                  option is being used to build the list.  T-1Y is one year prior to the list build's ending date/time.  
                                   
                                  "BDT" may also be used in the BDT or EDT fields and represents the beginning date/time specified by the user processing the list build action.  BDT-5Y creates a beginning date for the rule set sequence that is five years
                                  prior to the list build's beginning date/time.  
                                   
                                  A fixed date may also be defined in the BDT (e.g. 09/11/02).  
                                   
                                  If the beginning date/time is later than the ending date/time, then no finding matches will be found.

                                  The Ending Date/Time (EDT) defined for this rule set sequence will be overridden if the list rule, or term referenced in the list rule has a mapped finding with a Beginning Date/Time (BDT) or Ending Date/Time (EDT).  
                                   
                                  If the BDT and EDT are not defined on the rule set sequence, nor the list rule, nor the Reminder Term's mapped finding, then the patient list tools will use the List Build date range to find a match on findings. The List
                                  Build date range is the date range specified by the user selecting the list build action.  The list build date range is the Extract reporting period if an extract is being run.  
                                   
                                  If no date range limits should be used to match findings for this rule set sequence, the rule set sequence needs to be defined with a zero in the BDT or EDT fields, or both fields. Alternatively, the list build
                                  referenced by the sequence can be defined with a zero in its BDT or EFDT fields. The term referenced in the list rule should not have BDT and EDT fields defined. If zero is defined in the rule set sequence or list rule
                                  BDT, and the EDT is left blank, the list build tools will assume both BDT and EDT should not have date range limits, and vice versa if EDT has the 0 and the BDT is blank.  
                                   
                                  The use of "T" in the rule set sequence EDT field will always represent the ending date/time specified for the list build process or the extract reporting period, depending on whether a reminder patient list or extract
                                  option is being used to build the list. T-1Y is one year prior to the list build's ending date/time.  
                                   
                                  "BDT" may also be used in the BDT or EDT fields and represents the beginning date/time specified by the user processing the list build action.  For example BDT-5Y in the rule set sequence beginning date, and BDT in the
                                  list rule set sequence ending date will create a five year date range ending on the list build's beginning date/time.  
                                   
                                  A fixed date may also be defined in the EDT (e.g. 09/11/02).  
                                   
                                  If the ending date/time is earlier than the beginning date/time, then no finding matches will be found.
