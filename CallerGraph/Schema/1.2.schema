This file stores information about the editors that can be used to edit VA FileMan WP fields. The LINE EDITOR and SCREEN EDITOR are exported with VA FileMan, but instructions are given to allow site managers to enter local editors of their choice.  There
is a pointer in the NEW PERSON File to this file.  The pointed-to editor for that person is then used whenever the person edits a WP field.

              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code, used to set up the environment for editing a Standard FileMan word-processing field using this editor. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field holds the MUMPS code to properly establish the environment that will allow use of this editor to edit any VA FileMan word-processing type field.  Typically this code might move the text into another MUMPS global
                                (like ^UTILITY) or to some other file format for editing.  If the editor is written in MUMPS, it should either use variables that do not begin with the letter "D", or should NEW all its local variables to avoid problems on
                                return to the FileMan editor.  
                                 
                                If the variable DIWE(1) is defined, it indicated that the user has switched to this editor from the standard FileMan Line Editor, and upon return, the control will be returned to the line editor.  
                                 
                                This editor may set the variable DIWESW to 1, if they wish to allow the user to switch to an alternate editor from this one.  
                                 
                                This editor is required to restore the edited text to standard FileMan word-processing format before exiting.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>245 X D:$D(X) ^DIM
              LAST EDITED:      FEB 02, 1990 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code that sets $T to true if it is OK to use this editor. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field holds MUMPS code used to pre-check the environment before allowing the user to enter this editor.  This field should set the $TEST indicator.  If $TEST is true then it is OK for this editor to run at this time. 
                                If $T is false, the user will be returned to the FileMan line editor.  
                                 
                                If the field is null, it will be the same as $T=true 
                                 
                                An example would be a mixed VAX-PDP site using a VMS editor.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>245 X D:$D(X) ^DIM
              LAST EDITED:      FEB 02, 1990 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code used to restore the environment needed by the VA FileMan line editor. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                If the user switched to this editor from the FileMan line editor, then DIWE(1) exists.  This field should contain MUMPS code used to reset the environment needed by the Line Editor.
