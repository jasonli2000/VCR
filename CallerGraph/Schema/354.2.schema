This file contains the reasons for exemptions to a particular billing process.  Initially it will contain reasons only for the Pharmacy Copay Income exemption process.  This may be expanded in a later release to allow other exemptions to other processes. 
The current software expects certain entries in this file to exist.  Changing the data in this file can have major impact on the Pharmacy Copay process.  It should not be edited except on instruction from your ISC.  Generally instructions to modify this
file will be released through the National Patch Module on FORUM.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The data in this field is returned as the third piece from the call to RXST^IBARXEU and RXEXMT^IBARXEU0.  Programmers can determine certain attributes from the code.  Codes of 2 digits are reserved for exemption reasons
                                that can automatically be determined by the system but not based on income.  Codes of 3 digits are reserved for exemptions based on income.  Codes of 4 digits are reserved for exemptions that only can be manually entered
                                that would generally over-ride all other determinations.
