The A&SP DIAGNOSTIC CONDITION file (#509850.1) contains pointers to a small subset of ICD-9CM codes which pertain to Audiology and Speech Pathology.  Entries in this file are pointed to by the DIAGNOSTIC CODE field in the A&SP CLINIC VISIT file
(#509850.6).  
  
This file arrives at the VAMC with data.  This file SHOULD NOT be altered through the use of VA FileMan; input should take place ONLY through the QUASAR menu options.  
  
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition SHOULD NOT be modified.

              DESCRIPTION:      No longer used after the installation of Quasar Version 3.0.  The MODIFIERS ALLOWED field activates or inactivates ICD-9CM code modifiers (i.e., 0 for NO or 1 for YES).  ICD-9CM codes for Audiology and Speech Pathology may
                                not adequately describe the scope or variety of problems seen by audiologists and speech pathologists. Recognizing this deficiency, modifiers have been developed for certain codes to clarify diseases or to provide codes
                                for diseases where no codes now exist.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 0 for NO or 1 for YES. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Audiometric fields are required for C&P exams but are optional for routine exams.  The only exception to this is if the problem involves an ICD-9CM code which indicates a hearing loss.  The HEARING LOSS CODE field contains
                                1 or YES if this ICD-9CM code requires the asking of the audiometric questions.  The field contains 0 or NO if the ICD-9CM code is not a hearing loss code.

                                Periodically, ICD-9CM codes are inactivated by the code developers, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Director, Audiology and Speech Pathology Service (VAHQ).  Diagnostic codes which are not to be used are marked
                                as inactive.

                                  audiologists and speech pathologists. Recognizing this deficiency, modifiers have been developed for certain codes to clarify diseases  or to provide codes for diseases where no codes now exist. New modifiers should only
                                  be added at the direction of the Director, Audiology and Speech Pathology Service (VAHQ).  For some reporting applications, the modifiers will be deleted and only the standard ICD-9CM code will be reported.
