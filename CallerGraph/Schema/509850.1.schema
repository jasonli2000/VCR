The A&SP DIAGNOSTIC CONDITION file (#509850.1) contains pointers to a small subset of ICD CM codes which pertain to Audiology and Speech Pathology.  Entries in this file are pointed to by the DIAGNOSTIC CODE field in the A&SP CLINIC VISIT file
(#509850.6).  
  
This file arrives at the VAMC with data.  This file SHOULD NOT be altered through the use of VA FileMan; input should take place ONLY through the QUASAR menu options.

              DESCRIPTION:      Audiometric fields are required for C&P exams but are optional for routine exams.  The only exception to this is if the problem involves an ICD CM code which indicates a hearing loss.  The HEARING LOSS CODE field contains
                                1 or YES if this ICD CM code requires the asking of the audiometric questions.  The field contains 0 or NO if the ICD CM code is not a hearing loss code.
