The DSM MODIFIERS (#627.9) file contains the modifiers used by the DSM-III-R and DSM-IV diagnostic codes.  Originally, this file was named DSM-III-R MODIFIERS, had 36 entries, and was used exclusively for DSM-III-R purposes.  When the DSM-IV software was
created, this file was renamed, generically, to DSM MODIFIERS.  
 
When the DSM-IV modifiers were released, the following was true: 
  1.  The 36 entries in the original DSM-III-R MODIFIERS file were 
      identical to the first 36 entries in the DSM-IV modifiers.  
  2.  Entries after 37, were not present in the 
      DSM-III-R MODIFIERS file; they were truly new, unique entries.  
 
When the DSM-IV modifiers were released the following changes were made to the file: 
  1.  The PROMPT field (#1) was changed from 200 to 230 characters 
  2.  The file name was changed as noted above 
  3.  The file description was changed.  
  4.  A new multiple field - DSM VERSION - was added to the DSM 
      MODIFIERS file.  It was assigned field number 4.  The purpose 
      of this field was to track the versions by which each modifier 
      entry was used.  (Therefore, the first 36 entries have two 
      entries in this multiple:  DSM-III-R and DSM-IV.  And, the entries 
      unique to DSM-IV, entries after 37, have one entry in the 
      multiple: DSM-IV.)

              DESCRIPTION:      This is a prompt which is displayed for the different modifiers.  Usually, the prompt specifies the various selection (modifier) choices.  At times, prompts are displayed for informational purposes, and no user response is
