This file is used to store data for queued requests before the ECME engine un-queues them and during their processing. The data stored in this file are used to create a record in BPS TRANSACTION file (#9002313.59) to build a claim request or reversal and
send it to the insurer (payer).  Generally there should be few or no entries in this file unless there are stranded claims/reversal or requests that need to be un-stranded by the user.  
 
Per VHA Directive 2004-038, this file definition should not be modified.
