This file is used to record print jobs passed to a print server.  Under Linux a CUPS is used to provide print services and to manage print queues.  
 
Print jobs are passed to the print server via a host file.  Each time a host file is created a new entry will be created in this file.  The file will be purged of old entries on a regular basis.  
 
The principle use of this file is to insure that the name of the host file is unique.  A secondary use is to track the host files, for example, so that old files can be purged regularly, or to aid in troubleshooting of problems involving print queues.
