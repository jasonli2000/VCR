              DESCRIPTION:      This field is a variable pointer which allows coded system entries to be mapped to an entry in PCE's supporting files.  For example, a CPT code for Pneumovax, 90732 would be the value entered here, and the Related 
                                Supporting entry field would be PNEUMO-VAC in the Immunization file.  DO NOT use any general code such as 'OTHER SKIN TESTS' or 'OTHER PROCEDURE'.
