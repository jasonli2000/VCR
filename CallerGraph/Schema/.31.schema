This file stores information about keys on a file or subfile. A key is a set of one or more fields that uniquely identifies a record in a file. If more than one set of fields can uniquely identify a record, one of those sets should be designated the
primary key; all others should be designated secondary keys. The primary key is the principal means of identifying records in the file.  
 
To allow FileMan to enforce key uniqueness, the database designer must define a regular index that consists of all the fields that make up the key. This index is called the uniqueness index.  
 
All key fields must have values. They cannot be null.

                    uniqueness index.
