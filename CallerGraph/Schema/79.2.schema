This file contains, for each imaging type entry, parameters that the module uses during various stages of exam and report processing and inquiring. The parameter switches allow the 'customizing' of the module for each type of imaging.  
 
WARNING:  ENTRIES SHOULD NOT BE DELETED FROM THIS FILE.  
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
The data for the 'IMAGING TYPE' file is stored in the ^RA(79.2, global. At the present time this file is very static after day-one initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.  It should also be translated if the operating system
supports this function.  
 
 Input Templates 
 ---------------
The following is a list of input templates used by the package and the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template:

 Name                Routine  Description; Option(s) 
 ----                -------  ----------------------
 RA IMAGE PARAMETERS          Used to specify timeout seconds and whether 
                              the hardware system the module is running on 
                              is under fail-soft mode; 
                              RA FAILSOFT 
 
 RA ON-LINE CRITERIA          Used to indicate how long certain data should 
                              remain on file before it can be purged;
