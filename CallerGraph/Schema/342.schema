                                wish to have these notices pre-printed or duplicated, rather than having the AR software print them individually.

                                runs is the printing of the UB forms.  This parameter needs to be set to the device which contains the UB forms for printing.

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 14, 1993 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter defines the type of information to be displayed on the patient statement for RX copays.  Some patients may want to have very detailed information about any RX copay charges on their statement, while others
                                may require brief information.  This parameter will be the default for ALL patients and will define the amount of information displayed on the patient statement.  
                                 
                                A second related parameter can be defined for each patient that will over-ride this site parameter.  For example, if a site decides to have all their patients receive 'brief' information for RX copay charges, then this
                                parameter should be set to 'BRIEF'.  However, a particular patient may request more detailed information, in which case, this parameter should remain as BRIEF and the parameter for the patient should be set to DETAILED.

              LAST EDITED:      MAY 14, 1993 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter allows the site to suppress printing patient statements that have a zero balance.  A patient may have had activity during a particular month that has left the account balance at zero (ex., patient got a
                                $2.00 charge and paid it immediately).  The system will print this activity to inform the patient on a patient statement.  This information, even though the account balance is zero, is printed to confirm the payment was
                                applied correctly and also for reimbursement and 'proof' of payment to insurance companies.  
                                 
                                However, some sites may wish not to print these statements and provide the information on a 'as-needed' basis.

                                refund bills, etc.  This parameter is set when this process has completed every night.  If the process does not complete, the AR clerk will be warned and IRM should take action to resolve the problem.  If the process does
                                not run to completion, certain events that must occur may have not be run to completion.
