This file contains data elements as specified by the Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office for the Pharmacy Unit Dose extract from existing DHCP files. Entries into this file are made by extracting data from several files. Once approved by the DSS
site manager, entries in this file are loaded into an electronic mail message and sent to the commercial vendor. This file is intended to be used for validation purposes only. Entries should be made only by the extract load routine.  
  
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.  However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference, the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT
NUMBER field (#2).  This cross reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be modified.  
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.

                                stored instead of the IEN of the specialty.

                                7-digit string.  This is concatenated with a 12-digit code derived from the NDC field (#31) from the DRUG file (#50) to form a 19-digit Feeder Key.
