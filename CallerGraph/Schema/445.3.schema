USED BY GENERIC INVENTORY SYSTEM.  This file is used to store distribution orders from a Primary Inventory/ Distribution point to a Secondary.  An order can be entered either at the Primary, for the Secondary, or at the Secondary, if they are automated. 
When an order is posted, the inventory level at the affected inventory points are updated, history is updated, and the record is deleted from the file, unless items are backordered.  Items on backorder are left on the record until the back-order function
has been completed.
