The ESP OFFENSE REPORT file contains the offense report information.  This file points to the ESP MASTER NAME INDEX file (#910).  Once a case is closed, the offense report becomes the case history.  The offense report cannot be edited once a case is
closed, but can be reopened for editing by the appropriate authority.

                                known to be missing.  In these cases, use this field to enter the last date the item was known to be present.  Utilize the field 'ENDING DATE/TIME OF OFFENSE' to record the date the item was found to be missing.  Example: 
                                On 6/12/93@1000 an employee discovers a chain saw missing from the Engineering Shop (Ending Date/Time of Offense).  The investigation determines that no one remembers seeing it since 5/1/93@1630 (Date/Time of Offense).
