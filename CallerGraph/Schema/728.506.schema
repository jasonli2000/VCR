This file holds information needed to determine the DSS drug product code for any entry in the local DRUG file (#50) which has been matched to an entry in the NATIONAL DRUG file (#50.6).  The determining factors are VA classification, route of
administration, and, in some cases, specific VA product name.  These factors have been determined by the DSS pharmaceutical task force based, in part, on information provided by the National Drug File (NDF) task force.  Use of this file depends on fields
in the local DRUG file (#50) which were set by the matching process in the National Drug File package as specified by the NDF task force.  
 
For these reasons, it is imperative that neither the data nor the data dictionary for this file be modified at the local VAMC.  As modifications are required, they will be sent from the developers as directed by the involved task force members.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the product code as determined by the DSS pharmaceutical task force.  The DESCRIPTION field (#1) indicates how this code is determined by a combination of VA drug classification, route of administration, and (in
                                some cases) by specific generic name of a particular item.

                                  This cross reference is used to find the DSS drug product code for a drug selected out of the DRUG file (#50) based on information which links that drug to the NATIONAL DRUG file (#50.6) and defines the elements which
                                  were used to define drug product codes.
