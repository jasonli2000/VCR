              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the sequence code - 1 alpha and 4 numbers, e.g. Z9999 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field requires the entry of one alpha character and 4 numbers, in the form of A1111, to identify and place the prediction pattern in a coherent scheme of patterns.  The alpha characters identify the underlying
                                frequency, such as 'A' for monthly, 'K' for 8 times per year, etc.  The numbers place the prediction pattern in the proper sequence within its frequency type according to months, days, number of volumes, etc., according to
                                a predetermined format for the PREDICTION PATTERN NAME.  This file and all its accompanying fields are available for editing only under the National Library Files Maintenance option on FORUM.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field allows the volume field to be incremented at the month designated by the CHANGE MONTH field.  If the volume number increases by 1 at each CHANGE MONTH, the value in this field should be +1.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field will be used on all computed JOURNAL DATES other than the first JOURNAL DATE during the CHANGE MONTH.  The issue should be incremented by the amount stated in this field if the entry has a '+' as the first
                                character.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is for the input of the months at which the volume numbers increase, the values input from 1 to 12.  For instance, if a monthly serials title has two volumes per year, changing in January and July, the CHANGE
                                MONTH value should be:  1,7.
