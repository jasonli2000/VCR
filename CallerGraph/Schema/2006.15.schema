The purpose of this table is to specify the first groups of digits for the unique object identifiers that will be generated by the software.  Note that this "root" for the UIDs is organization-specific, and that the FOIA release of this software will
only include data for this table for VA sites.  
 
See the DICOM Standard (www.nema.org/dicom) PS 3.8 Annex A for instructions on how to obtain a valid UID root.

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 04, 2004 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter this organization's UID root code as obtained from ISO (1-90 chars). 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string that represents this organization's UID root code.  
                                 
                                Values for this code must be obtained from the International Standards Organization (ISO) or from their national representative bodies (for the USA, this is ANSI).  
                                 
                                The format of an UID root code looks like a list of integer numbers, separated by periods.  
                                 
                                For VA hospitals, the value for this field will be automatically entered.  
                                 
                                Other organizations first need to obtain their "root code" from the appropriate standards organization, and then manually enter the assigned value into this field.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the date and time of the last UID generation. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field contains the date and time that the last DICOM UID was generated.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is incremented every time a new DICOM UID is generated. This field is reset to one ('1') daily when a new DICOM UID is generated for the first time during the day. This field supplements LAST DATETIME UID
                                GENERATED field (2006.15,2) to prevent duplicate DICOM UIDs within one second interval of generation requests.
