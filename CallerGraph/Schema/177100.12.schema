              HELP-PROMPT:      If your site web server setup requires a "change directory" command, enter 1 for YES. If you change this value, always check to make sure it does what you want. 
              DESCRIPTION:       This field controls an additional instruction for the VMS com files that this application constructs during exection. The com file has commands for the FTP program to move a web page to a server.  
                                 
                                Some sites, according to the revision of they have (Windows 2000 server versus Windows 2003 server) and may arrive in the FTP root directory and may need to issue this command to go to the correct directory: 
                                 
                                        where 'mydirectory' is the name of the directory that needs 
                                          to be changed to: 
                                 
                                                cd mydirectory 
                                 
                                Setting this field to 1 or YES will insert the above command into the script and force a directory change.  
                                 
                                The necessity of this command is dictated by the IIS revision.  Under IIS versions less than v6, a proper virtual directory access is not feasible and the command must be used.  SURE to check the success.  
                                 
                                NT sites do not need this switch but if used will not interfere with the transfer.  VMS sites must be careful because if you issue this command and it is not needed, the com file will fail.
