  This file holds the abbreviations which are often used when entering the Rx sig.  Each record holds an expansion of the abbreviation which is used to complete the sig as it is printed on the Rx label.  Care should be taken to not delete entries in this
file after going into production use of the pharmacy package.  If an entry were deleted then any sigs that contain the abbreviation would not find it when printed later and thus could confuse the patient.  
 
The above description indicates that this file is not strictly 'pointed to' in the classical VA FileMan sense, but that logically it is nearly the same thing.
