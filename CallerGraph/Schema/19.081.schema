The Kernel Site Parameters File establishes when and how a log of option usage will be recorded in this file.  For the indicated time period, all specified options, namespaces, and users will be audited.  Each time an audit is put into effect, it is
recommended that the number of audited entities be at a minimum so that disk space is not inadvertently wasted.  This file is cross-referenced by option.
