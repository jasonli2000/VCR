This file holds interim DRGs computed by the Claims Tracking Module for display in Claims Tracking and on Reports.  The computed ALOS is based upon 1992 HCFA average lengths of stay and not VA averages.  The purpose is to help utilization review
personnel determine if the the ALOS approved by an insurance company is within industry standards.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
