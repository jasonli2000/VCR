Spinal Cord Dysfunction Site Parameter File.  Contains control values that regulate the operation of the SCD data extraction for the National SCD Registry.  This file is critical to that operation.  If no site parameter record is present; default values
will automatically be used and will update the file.  If specific fields are blank/null default values will be used to update this file.  
  Patch **2** applied to this file updating fields 1 and 2 to raise the lowest acceptable values for these two fields.
