              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the date and time the patient education was given. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the date and time the education was given by the provider.  This date and time may be different from the visit date and time.  For example, for clinic appointment visits, the visit date and time is the date and
                                time of the appointment, not the time the provider performed the clinical event.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE User Interface, which allows manual entry of data, will be the prmary source of the event date and time.  The event date prompt defaults to the visit date and the time is entered to reflect the actual time the exam
                                was given. The event date does not have to be the visit date, but it must be within 30 days before or after the visit, and not be a future date.  
                                 
                                If a user wnats to enter an historical measurement, the user should use the Historical Encounter entry action to document the historical measurement. Historical entries will not be eligible for credit.

                                If the record is a new record, then an "A" is used to specify the source that added the data.  If the record existed previously, PCE filing logic compares the old and new records of information.  An "E" will automatically
                                be used if the filing logic finds the data has been edited.  If "E" is used, then the Edited Flag field is automatically set to 1.  
                                 
                                The DUZ is stored in its internal format to represent the user who performed the adding or editing of data for this record.
