This file implements the concept of 'First In First Out' (FIFO) stock accounting.  
 
Whenever stock items are brought into stock on a given date an entry will be created for that date for the relevant HCPC item, location, vendor and unit of measure. The date will include time to cater for the rare instance where the same stock item with
the same vendor, location and unit of measure is brought into stock on the same day but with a different cost.  
 
This file can then be used to look up locations containing the oldest stock for any given HCPC item.  
 
When items are removed from stock the associated vendor and location will be identified by scanning a bar code (or manual entry in case of equipment problems). The system will then assume that the oldest item for the vendor and location has been issued
and will reduce the stock quantity. If the quantity becomes 0 or -ve the record will be deleted.
