This file contains vocabulary subsets of the main Expressions file (#757.01).  Each sub-set is defined in file #757.2, and may contain [pointers to] terms which are exclusive to a discipline (i.e., Nursing), a device (i.e., Grid Pad), or an application
(i.e., Order Checking, Encounter Form, etc).

                                Contains a pointer to an expression (file #757.01), however, that expression (not the pointer) is indexed in this file, thus creating the impression of a separate vocabulary.

                                ^LEX(757.21,"C",EXP,IEN) - where EXP is a 63 character uppercase expression taken from the Expression file #757.01 Display Text (.01) and IEN is the Internal Entry Number of the Subsets file #757.21 where the expression
                                pointer is located.  This index simulates the functionality of the B index in the Expression file #757.01.

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 22, 1994 
              DESCRIPTION:      Pointer to the subset definitions (file 757.2).  This pointer indicates how the expression is to be indexed (i.e., pointing to the Nursing subset in the definition file creates an index of the expression with the 
                                cross-reference of "ANUR")

                                ^LEX(757.21,IDX,WORD,IEN) - where IDX is the subset index (the letter "A" appended to the Short Title of the subset taken from the Subset Definition file #757.2), WORD is a single word parsed from the Display Text of the 
                                Expression file #757.01 pointed to by the expression (.01), and IEN is the Internal Entry Number of the Subsets file #757.21 where the pointer of the expression containing the WORD and the pointer to the Subset Definition
                                are located.  The "AA" index does not exist physically.  The indexing routine determines the vocabulary which is used (as pointed to in the Subset Definition file #757.2, i.e., NUR).  It then appends a leading "A" to the 
                                vocabulary mnemonic (Short Title) creating a composite index identifier (i.e., "ANUR").  Finally, it parses and indexes the words found in the expression (pointed to by the .01 field) using the composite index identifier.  
                                For example, ^LEX(757.21,DA,0)= 262363^2, where 262363 points to the expression "ABUSED ADULT, POTENTIAL" and 2 points to the Subset definition "Nursing" with the vocabulary mnemonic "NUR", the words "ABUSED", "ADULT" and 
                                "POTENTIAL" would be indexed at ^LEX(757.21,"ANUR",WORD,IEN).
