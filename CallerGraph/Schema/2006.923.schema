This file maps retention policies, via an acquisition location, to the storage providers that should be used to satisfy that retention policy.  
 
In a valid configuration, the attributes on the retention policy (i.e Minimum Archive Copies, etc) can be matched to the corresponding attributes of the mapped storage provider (i.e. Archive), to see whether the configuration is valid.  
 
This file also holds a flag indicating whether a particular provider should be called synchronously or asynchronously.
