                                 The name given to the line. Lines should be given names that will allow them to be identifies, such as V(1,1), meaning a vertical line starting at coordinates (1,1).

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The internal representation starts at 0, the external representation starts at 1. The difference is because for computing the form image it is convenient to work with displacements from the top left-hand corner. However,
                                users do not want to work with row=0 or column=0.
