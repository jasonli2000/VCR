This file provides a holding place for data being transferred by the KERMIT protocol.  By default the data can only be accessed by the user that created it.  
 
The Kermit Menu (XT-KERMIT options) may be used to send and receive data via this file.  The menu also allows the creator of the data to permit access by others.  This file is cross-referenced by name, creator, and access allowed to user.
