              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a CLASS OF CASE code. 
              DESCRIPTION:       CLASS OF CASE reflects the facility's role in managing the cancer, whether the cancer is required to be reported by CoC, and whether the case was diagnosed after the program's Reference Date.  
                                 
                                CLASS OF CASE divides cases into two groups.  
                                 
                                Analytic cases (codes 00-22) are those that are required by CoC to be abstracted because of the program's primary responsibility in managing the cancer.  Analytic cases are grouped according to the location of diagnosis
                                and first course of treatment.  
                                 
                                Nonanalytic cases (codes 30-49 and 99) may be abstracted by the facility to meet central registry requirements or in response to a request by the facility's cancer program.  Nonanalytic cases are grouped according to the
                                reason a patient who received care at the facility is nonanalytic, or the reason a patient who never received care at the facility may have been abstracted.

                                sequentially.  Code 59 for the fifty-ninth of fifty-nine independent malignant or in situ primaries.  Code 99 for an unspecified malignant or in situ sequence number or unknown.

                                Clinical-diagnostic staging is used for those sites that are accessible, i.e. cervix, oral cavity, larynx, and for those organs where evaluation of extent must be made only on the  basis of clinical-diagnostic findings. 
                                Clinical-diagnostic staging is based on the physical examination, diagnostic imaging, clinical pathology, and biopsy of the primary.  
                                 
                                Postsurgical pathological staging is a combination of all findings - clinical-diagnostic, surgical-evaluative, and postsurgical retreatment-pathological.

                                Adjuvant - refers to additional treatment, usually given after surgery where all detectable disease has been removed, but where there remains a statistical risk of relapse due to occult disease.  
                                 
                                Neoadjuvant - in contrast to adjuvant therapy, is given prior to primary treatment, for example, before surgery to remove the tumor.  The most common reason for neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce the size of the tumor so as
                                to facilitate more effective surgery.

                                Palliative - chemotherapy given without expectation of a cure.

                                Adjuvant - refers to additional treatment, usually given after surgery where all detectable disease has been removed, but where there remains a statistical risk of relapse due to occult disease.  
                                 
                                Neoadjuvant - in contrast to adjuvant therapy, is given prior to primary treatment, for example, before surgery to remove the tumor.  The most common reason for neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce the size of the tumor so as
                                to facilitate more effective surgery.    
                                 
                                Concomitant or concurrent - radiation therapy at the same time as chemotherapy.  
                                 
                                Palliative - radiation therapy given without expectation of a cure.

              DESCRIPTION:       Records the dominant modality of radiation therapy used to deliver the most clinically significant boost dose to the primary volume of interest during the first course of treatment.  This is accomplished with external
                                beam fields of reduced size (relative to the regional treatment fields), implants, stereotactic radiosurgery, conformal therapy, or IMRT.  External beam boosts may consist of two or more successive phases with
                                progressively smaller fields generally coded as a single entry.

                                numbers of the two patterns are added to obtain the Gleason score, which ranges from 02 to 10.  Record the Gleason's score by adding the predominant and lesser patterns as stated in the pathology report.  For example, if
                                predominant pattern is 3 and lesser pattern is 4, then Gleason's score is 3 + 4 = 7.  For cases where Gleason's score is unknown, not reported or not applicable, code 99.

                                considered esophageal (C15.0-C15.9).  This information may be obtained from the pathology report.
