                DESCRIPTION:      A caption is uneditable text that appears on the screen.  Captions of data dictionary, form-only, and computed fields serve to identify for the user the data portion of the fields.  Captions for these types of fields are
                                  automatically followed by a colon, unless the Suppress Colon After Caption property is set to 'YES.'  A field with an Executable Caption must have '!M' as a Caption.

                                  FORM ONLY fields are fields defined only on the form and are not tied to a field in a FileMan file.  
                                   
                                  DATA DICTIONARY fields are fields from a FileMan file.  
                                   
                                  COMPUTED fields, like form-only fields, are fields that are defined only on the form.  Associated with a COMPUTED field is a computed expression.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter text, 1-20 characters in length, which represents the group to which this field belongs. 
                DESCRIPTION:      Display group helps users resolve ambiguity when they attempt to ^-jump to a field that has a caption that is not unique.  If more than one field has the same caption, when users try to ^-jump to a field with that
                                  caption, they are presented with a list of fields to choose from.  The text in the Display Group property is displayed in parentheses after the caption to help the user identify the correct field.  
                                   
                                  For example, if two fields have the caption 'NAME:', but one of those fields has a Display Group 'Next of Kin', when users enter ^NAME, they will be asked to choose between 'NAME' and 'NAME (Next of Kin)'.

                DESCRIPTION:      Whenever the user attempts a Save, ScreenMan checks all required fields on all pages accessed during the editing session, as well as all pages linked to the first page via the Next and Previous Page links.  If any of the
                                  required fields have null values, no Save occurs.  You need not make a field required that is already required by its data definition.

                DESCRIPTION:      Answer 'YES' to ask the user whether the looked-up entry is 'OK'. If only one match is made to the user's lookup value, then ScreenMan will ask "OK?" instead of automatically selecting the found entry. This property 
                                  corresponds to the "V" flag in the DIC(0) input variable to ^DIC and only pertains to multiple-valued fields.

                                  field.

                DESCRIPTION:      This MUMPS code is executed whenever the user presses <RET> at the field.  Here you can set DDSBR equal to the field, block, and page, separated by up-arrow delimiters, of the field to which you wish to take users when
                                  they press <RET>.  For example, 
                                   
                                       S:X="Y" DDSBR="TEST FIELD 1^TEST BLOCK 1^TEST PAGE 2" 
                                   
                                  would take the user to the field with unique name or caption "TEST FIELD 1" on the block named "TEST BLOCK 1" on a page named "TEST PAGE 2".  
                                   
                                  Alternatively, if you wish to take users to another page when they press <RET> at this field, and then when they close that page, automatically take them to the field immediately following this field, you can set 
                                  DDSSTACK equal to the page name or number of that page.  
                                   
                                  The variable X contains the current internal value of the field, DDSEXT contains the current external value of the field, and DDSOLD contains the previous internal value of the field.
