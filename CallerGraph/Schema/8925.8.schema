              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must correspond to a valid x-ref in file 8925. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the cross-reference which will be searched to identify the corrresponding documents.  It must have the structure: 
                                 
                                ^TIU(8925,"<X-REF NAME>",ENTITY,DOCTYP,STATUS,INVDATE,IEN)="" where ENTITY is the object of the search, DOCTYPE is the .01 field value of the record in 8925, STATUS is the value of the .05 field in 8925, and inverse date
                                is the inverted reference date (field 1301 in file 8925), computed as 9999999-REFDATE.

                                This REGULAR FileMan cross-reference is used to map SEARCH CATEGORY to CROSS REFERENCE.

                                This MUMPS-type cross-reference is used to update the timestamp on the search category selection menu when a DISPLAY NAME changes.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Select the file to which the category will refer. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the file on which a look-up will occur in the event that a category is selected (e.g., for category PATIENT, the file should be 2, and for category AUTHOR, the file should be 200).

              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is MUMPS code, which sets the special variable DIC("S"), prior to invoking the look-up on the FILE identified with the category.

              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This code is invoked, if defined, and should behave like a call to ^DIC, setting the variable Y as IFN^VALUE.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the $HOROLOG date/time of a change. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field stores the $HOROLOG-formatted date/time for a change to a Search Categories entry.

                                This cross-reference invokes menu compilation in ^XUTL("XQORM", DA;TIU(8925.8, when the TIMESTAMP field is modified.
