              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field holds the name of the parameter entry.  (Only one entry, internal entry number 1 should exist.)  The value of this field has no affect on software execution.

              LAST EDITED:      MAY 18, 2003 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field should be set to ACTIVE if the master job should run, and INACTIVE if the master job should not run.  This field also controls individual monitor jobs.  (Note that setting this field has no affect on queued
                                future Taskman jobs - either the master job or the monitor jobst - until these jobs start.  If this field is set to INACTIVE, when queued jobs start they check this field and immediately stop.)

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 5 and 1440, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                When a master job runs, it's first action is to queue a new master job task in the future.  This field is used to determine the number minutes in the future that the task is queued.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>12000)!(X<2)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      MAY 28, 2003 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 2 and 12000, 0 Decimal Digits

                                'I' FOR INACTIVE; 
              LAST EDITED:      MAY 18, 2003 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is similar to the STATUS-MASTER field, (and you should read the description of that field), but only controls individual monitor jobs.  If this field is set to INACTIVE, no new monitor jobs will be queued.  And,
                                if any monitor jobs are already queued, they will stop immediately when they start.
