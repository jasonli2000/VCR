This file has been designed for joint use by the Indian Health Service and the Department of Veteran Affairs.  POV is an abbreviation for "Purpose of Visit" (descriptive name used by IHS) or "Problem of Visit" (descriptive name used by VA).  
 
The V POV file is used to store clinical data related to the "purpose of visit" or "problem of visit", (POV). This is the provider's definition of what diagnosis to use to represent the patient care given at the visit.  The POV entry is not the patient's
"Chief Complaint" text.  It is the diagnosis as defined by the provider which will have an ICD Diagnosis code related to it to support Clinical needs and additionally support Administrative functions too such as Billing, Workload, and DSS.  
 
There should be at least one "purpose of visit" (descriptive name used by IHS) or one "problem of visit" (descriptive name used by the VA) in the V POV file for each patient visit whether it is an inpatient, outpatient or field visit, and regardless of
the discipline of the provider (i.e.  dental, CHN, mental health, etc.). There is no limit to the number of POV's that can be entered for a patient for a given encounter.  
  
At IHS facilities, POV's are generated automatically for this file at time of discharge from the Admission, Discharge and Transfer (ADT) system.  POV's are entered in narrative form, and coded automatically to the appropriate ICD9 code. Physician entered
narrative which modifies the diagnosis, such as "doubtful, suspect, resolved" are entered by the data entry person in the MODIFIER field.  Narrative qualifiers, such as "not healing well", "date of onset", "severe" etc.. are stored in the NARRATIVE 
QUALIFIER field.  STAGE is used only as a local option.  The file contains pointers to the IHS Patient file, and visit file, and data must exist in both of these files for this visit before a POV can be entered here.  
 
At VA facilities, POV is used as an abbreviation for "Problem of Visit", or the problem treated at the visit.  POV's are primarily created for clinic visits from 3 sources: 
  1) The scheduling checkout process, in which case the information collected about the POV is limited to the ICD Diagnosis code.  The provider narrative becomes the ICD narrative from the ICD Diagnosis file.  
  2) The Encounter Form automated data scanning (AICS package).  In this case the provider narrative is the terminology defined by the clinician to represent the diagnosis on the encounter form. The AICS package, or other automated data capture tool, is
able to pass the narrative and the ICD Diagnosis.  If the problem treated at the visit was a pre-existing problem from the patient's "Problem List", the related problem entry is also stored in the POV record. (The Problem List orientation is not utilized
by IHS.) 
  3) The manual data entry process for encounter form data not collected via automated data capture.  This process is the most like the process IHS

              DESCRIPTION:      POV is an abbreviation for "Purpose of Visit".  Since Purpose of Visit is often confused with "Chief complaint", another abbreviation might better be  "Problem of Visit".  This is the Provider's conclusion about what was 
                                treated at the visit.  The Provider should be able to indicate a preferred narrative for what was treated and an ICD Diagnosis code.  If the problem treated is from the Problem List, then the problem list entry information 
                                can be used for the "Problem of Visit" entry.  The provider can alternatively have this information automatically captured via scanned Encounter Forms (e.g., AICS - the VA's Encounter Form Data Capture package).  
                                 
                                At VA facilites, the ICD Diagnosis is screened by Inactive Code and it must be appropriate for the Patient's age and sex.

                                time, clinic activity can be captured for clinical use as well as be used for billing and workload information by the appropriate VA packages.  If the visit was for a walk-in, an appointment should be entered in Scheduling
                                first in order to have the clinical information also be used for the administrative uses.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the provider narrative or clinical terminology for the diagnosis treated. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is the clinical lexicon term which most closely represents the provider narrative of the problem treated.  
                                 
                                At VA facilities: The clinical lexicon is automatically captured via encounter form data capture (AICS package) when the of problem being treated is from the Active Problem List.  In the manual data entry process, there is
                                currently no prompt for the clinical term.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field was created by the VA to capture the clinical lexicon term, as an alternative to, or in addition to the ICD9 Diagnosis code.  This field will primarily be populated when the diagnosis being treated at a visit is
                                based on an entry in the Active Problem List.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field was added for use by PCE in the VA.  
                                 
                                Automated data capture methods, that allow the problems treated at a visit to be selected from the active problem list, will be able to provide the problem list entry which is stored in this field.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field identifies a diagnosis as being Ordering, Resulting, or both Ordering and Resulting.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the date and time this problem was treated. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the actual date and time of the encounter.  This date and time may be different than the visit date and time specified in the Visit file.  However it must be within 30 days of the Visit date and Not be a future 
                                date.  
                                 
                                This field is useful for capturing the actual time encounters take place, or when, during the encounter, something happened.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field was added for use by PCE in the VA, to support the capture of the actual event date and time of the encounter which is not reflected in the Visit file entry.  IHS allows the Visit date and time to be the actual 
                                date and time. But, the VA uses the Visit date and time as the Appointment date and time, rather than the "Actual" encounter event date and time.  The Appointment date and time orientation of visits allows the VA
                                Scheduling, billing and workload functionality to understand the linkage between the clinical data being captured for a visit and the existing Outpatient Scheduled events.

              DESCRIPTION:      For consistency, this field was added to each V-file.  However, for the V POV, the Ordering Provider does not apply itself well, unless a provider is ordering another provider to treat a problem. Optionally, in the future,
                                this field may be able to represent the provider responsible for the encounter providers work.
