This file is used to keep track of the various queues and queue-threads that are used to conduct automated routing.  
 
The information in this file will be used by end-users to view which queue-threads are active, and to indicate that queue-threads are to be stopped or resumed.  
 
The various queue-processors will query this file to see whether a request has been posted to stop (suspend) the queue-thread that they are processing.
