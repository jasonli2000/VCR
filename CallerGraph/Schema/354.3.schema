This file contains the threshold amounts for the Medication Copayment Income Exemption.  The Medication Copayment Income Exemption legislation was effective on 30-Oct-92.  The thresholds are normally effective on December 1.  To simplify implementation
VACO has determined that the threshold effective 1-Dec-92 would be used for the period from 30-Oct-92 to 1-Dec-92.  
 
The Medication Copayment Income Exemption from 1992 thru 11/30/96 was based on veterans making less than the VBA rate for pension plus Aid and Attendence.  
 
With the filing of the 1996 thresholds,  the directive was changed to reflect that the Medication Copayment Income Exemption was to be based on veterans making less than the VBA rate for Basic Pension.  This is the directive that is still in effect for
current rates.  
 
 
 
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

                                This is the rate for each additional dependent.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Calculation of the threshold amount will be based on the number of dependents a veteran has.  First the base rate will be determined.  Second, look at the rate for the veteran with the correct number of dependents.  Third,
                                if the entry for the veteran and the number of dependents is null, then the threshold will be the base rate plus the rate for each additional dependent times the number of dependents.
