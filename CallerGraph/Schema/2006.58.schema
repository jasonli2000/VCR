Data recorded in this file will be set and removed by the VISTA DICOM gateway.  Please do not edit entries in this file.  
 
A message display and logging facility is provided in the VISTA DICOM gateway by the ^MAGDMLOG routine. Status, informational, progress, and warning messages generated by the various processes are passed to the routine via the MESSAGE entry point. The
messages for the process are stored in the ^MAGDMLOG global, where they can be retrieved (from ^MAGDMENU or programmer mode) by invoking the DUMP entry point. Each message is also displayed in real-time on the MSM Console window, if the window is free
(i.e., not owned by another job).
