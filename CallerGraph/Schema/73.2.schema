This file contains only data supplied by the Office of Patient Care Services.  The data are sent to the Radiology development and maintenance teams as an Excel spreadsheet.  Updates to the data are sent as a comprehensive spreadsheet, so all entries in
this file must be deleted before loading the new comprehensive spreadsheet into this file.  
 
This file provides data for certain CPT Codes.  One of the data items is PROCEDURE TYPE.  The PROCEDURE TYPE is similar to the Type of Imaging in the IMAGING TYPE file (#79.2), and is needed from this file to compare PROCEDURE TYPES nationally for
performance monitors and performance measures, because not all sites are assigning the same Type of Imaging to the same CPT Code via the RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURES file (#71).
