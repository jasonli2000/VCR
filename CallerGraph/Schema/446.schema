USED BY GENERIC INVENTORY SYSTEM.  
  This file is used to store data needed for cost accounting.  The data is updated automatically by the Generic Inventory system, when a distribution order (from a Primary to a Secondary) is posted, when an adjustment is made to distribution, or when
usage within an inventory point is recorded.  The file keeps a record of total dollars distributed /used by month, and by the cost center that distributed or used the supplies.  Reports can then be generated from this file by cost center, or broken down
further by MIS Bed Sections (defined for each inventory point).  NOTE: For usage within an inventory/point (i.e. goods were distributed to the end user at this point and not distributed to another inventory/ distribution point), the DISTRIBUTED TO and
DISTRIBUTED FROM fields will be the same.

                                This cross reference is used to sort the distribution history by the month/year an item is distributed.  The node prcp(446,"ac",MOYR,da) is set where the MOYR is the month/year distributed.

                                This cross reference is used to sort the distribution history by the inventory point distributing the items.  The node prcp(446,"ad",INVPT,da) is set where INVPT is the internal inventory point number from which items are
