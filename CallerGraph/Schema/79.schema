--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file contains, for each division entry, parameters that the module uses during various stages of exam and report processing and inquiring.  These parameter switches allow the 'customizing' of the module for each division by the package coordinator.  
 
The module is designed to handle multiple divisions within a medical center.  While most medical centers only have one division, there are a number that are multi-divisional.  As a result, it was necessary to structure the entire system around the
division concept.  
 
However, single division medical centers will not notice this in the everyday execution of the module.  
 
Within a division there may be a number of physical locations where an imaging procedure can be performed.  The module is designed to handle multiple locations within a division.  However, each location can only be associated with one division.  Location
data is stored in the 'IMAGING LOCATIONS' file (#79.1).  
 
These parameters are loaded into the user's partition once the module determines which division and location the user is currently associated with.  This is determined by one of two ways: 1) the device the user is using is an entry in the 'INPUT DEVICES'
sub-file of the 'IMAGING LOCATIONS' file or 2) if (1) is not true than the module will simply ask the user what his/her current location is.  Method 1 is becoming obsolete; it was used before virtual terminals came into being.  Therefore, most systems
will ask the user for a sign-on imaging location.  
 
 
Entries in this file should not be deleted. Adding new entries is always allowed.  
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
The data for the 'RAD/NUC MED DIVISION' file is stored in the ^RA(79, global. At the present time this file is very static after day-one initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.  It should also be translated if the operating
system supports this function.  
 
 Input Templates 
 ---------------
The following is a list of input templates used by the package and the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template: 
 
                        Compiled 
 Name                   Routine   Description; Option(s) 
 ----                   -------   ----------------------
 RA DIVISION PARAMETERS           Used to enter/edit division parameters 
                                  that the package coordinator controls; 
                                  RA SYSDIV 
 
If any modifications to these input templates are needed for local purposes, then great care should be taken not to degrade any branching logic in the template.  
 
 Print Templates 
 ---------------
 The following is a list of print templates used by the radiology package: 
 
 Name                  Description; Option(s)

              DESCRIPTION:      This 'division' parameter is used if the 'Track Exam Status Changes' parameter is set to 'Yes'.  This parameter may be set to 'Yes' to indicate that the user should be asked the time of the status change. If this parameter
                                is set to 'No', then the system automatically uses the current date and time.  
                                 
                                (If exam data is entered significantly later than the patient is actually processed, then this parameter could be set to 'Yes' so that the user can put in the actual time the work was done.)

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'Y'es if the transcriptionist should be allowed to batch reports. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This 'division' parameter can be set to 'Yes' if the transcriptionist should be given the opportunity to place reports in a batch during report entry.  
                                 
                                    Batching of reports has the following advantages: 
                                    1)  Reports can be re-printed easily 
                                    2)  Two or more users are allowed to use the same 
                                        report printer without interweaving of reports 
                                    3)  Allows for batch verifying of reports 
                                    4)  Provides a mechanism for logical grouping of reports

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'Y'es if you don't want users asked for their codes when processing exams. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This 'division' parameter can be set to indicate that the user should be asked for their access code during the processing of exams and reports of which various activity logs are kept.  If this parameter is set to 'Yes', 
                                then the system automatically uses the user code associated with the initial logon.  If this parameter is set to 'No', then the system asks the access code during each process.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the Resource Device for this division. 
              DESCRIPTION:      A Resource device may be entered here if the facility wishes to control the rate at which tasked exam status updates are released to be processed.  This is advised if the facility is experiencing drastic system slowdowns 
                                due to periodic heavy use of the online report verification and batch verification of reports options, which can queue a large number of tasks at once.  However, if the facility chooses to enter a Resource Device in this
                                field, IRM should be careful to completely follow all directions in Kernel documentation after a system crash to bring this Resource Device back up.  Failure to follow those directions could result in Rad/Nuc Med tasks
                                being severely delayed, and data corruption.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter "??" for more info on SMTP addresses.  Length of address must be between 12 and 60 characters. 
                DESCRIPTION:        This is the SMTP address for the OUTLOOK mail group or person who should receive the Radiology Performance Indicator Summary Report.  The SMTP address is the form of the e-mail address that a user from the Internet 
                                  would use when sending e-mail to Outlook.  
                                   
                                  The SMTP address of the mail group or user can be found as follows from the OUTLOOK Address Book: 
                                     1. Double click on the name of the Mail Group or person 
                                        from the Outlook Address Book 
                                     2. Select the "E-mail Addresses" tab 
                                     3. The SMTP address is displayed after the first "SMTP:" line.  
                                        It will have the format <name>@domain.ext 
                                   
                                  For example: 
                                     In the address book, there's a group name called "VAH FAKE Report".  
                                     To find that group name's SMTP address from OUTLOOK: 
                                        1. Tools --> Address Book 
                                        2. Enter  VAH FAKE Report  inside the box called 
                                             "Type Name or Select from List:" 
                                        3. A new screen entitled "VAH FAKE Report Properties" should be 
                                              displayed.  
                                        4. Click on the tab entitled "E-mail Addresses" 
                                        5. A new box should be displayed.  
                                        6. The "SMTP:" line would have the SMTP address for "VAH FAKE 
                                           Report".  It would be something like:  VAHFAKEReport@va.med.gov 
                                           Note: 
                                           If there is an "SMTP:" line and another "smtp:" line, use 
                                           the SMTP address from the all caps "SMTP:" line.  
                                        7. The e-mail address you enter MUST end in @domain.ext

                                  The performance indicator options will check this field to determine if a report should be sent to the corresponding SMTP address.  
                                   
                                  If this field is "Y", then the corresponding SMTP address would receive the automatic mid-month report.  But it will only receive manually initiated reports if that report was requested for (1) a full month's data (any
                                  full month in the past), and (2) the user replies "Y" to the question about sending the output to "OQP Performance Mgmt".  
                                   
                                  If this field is "N", then the corresponding SMTP address would receive all reports, whether automatic or manually initiated.
