This file contains the pointers for the Imaging Background Queue file. It tracks the status of queue processing.  
 
 The Background Processor uses three files: 
              1. Queue   (2006.03) 
              2. Queue Pointer   (2006.031) 
              3. Jukebox  (2006.032) 
 
There are five different tasks that can be performed by the background processor: 
 
1. ABSTRACT -- create a small version of an image 
 
2. EXPORT ---- copy an image to an export directory so that it can be used outside the imaging system 
 
3. IMPORT ----copy an image from an import directory into the imaging system 
 
4. JUKEBOX ---copy an image from hard disk to the jukebox 
 
5. JBTOHD ----copy an image from the jukebox to the hard disk 
 
There is a single Input Queue file for all the requests, with a cross-reference to request type.  The background processor processes the entries in a prioritized first-in first-out fashion, and uses the Queue Pointer file to record its progress. The
background processor uses the Jukebox file for device-specific information.  The jukebox platters are logically placed into the Network Location file, and are pointed to by the Jukebox file and the Image file.  Jukeboxes, which can be configured as a 
single volume, only have a single entry in the network location file.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a number between 0 and 99999999, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This value is the total number of queues in the queue partition of this type for this local area Vista Imaging network.  This value can be used in conjunction with the Queue Count field (#2) to determine the number of 
                                queues in the failed queue partition.  i.e. Queue Type Total - Queue Count = failed queues (for this "PLACE" and this queue type)..
