                                  This is the name of the field as defined in the array passed across to PCE.  Examples of this field are: ENC D/T=Visit Date/Time, PATIENT=Patient, HOS LOC=Clinic, PROCEDURE=Procedure CPT, DIAGNOSIS=Diagnosis ICD9.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-25 characters in length. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This is the internal value of the field, that was passed to PCE and caused the error message.  The type for this field will obviously depend on the value of PCE FIELD NAME.  For instance, if field name is ENC D/T (Visit
                                  Date/Time) then this field will contain an internal Fileman Date/Time value. If the field name is PATIENT then this field will contain the pointer to the PATIENT File.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the External value of the field that was rejected by PCE.  As with the Internal Value field, the type of value in this field will depend on the PCE FIELD NAME that caused the error.  If the PCE FIELD
                                  NAME is ENC D/T then this field will contain the external value of the Visit Date/Time. If the PCE FIELD NAME is PATIENT then this field will contain the Patient Name.  It is not always possible to determine the external
                                  value of the PCE FIELD NAME and so in some cases this field will be blank.

                DESCRIPTION:      The PROCEDURE CODE field contains a CPT procedure code for this exam.  QUASAR accepts multiple CPT-4 codes and displays a sequential count of entered procedures.  QUASAR allows the same CPT-4 code to be entered more than
                                  once if the second and subsequent codes are enclosed in quotation marks (e.g., "92507").  If this is not done, QUASAR assumes that the entry is a mistake and displays the entered code followed by double slant bars (e.g.,
                                  92507//).  This signals you that this code has already been entered for this visit.

                                  The MODIFIER field has been marked for deletion.  This field is not used by QUASAR V. 3.0.  Eighteen months after the release of QUASAR 3.0, this field can be removed.  Any Modifiers already defined for Procedure codes

              DESCRIPTION:       DIAGNOSIS: |NOWRAP| 
                                 1. Summary of audiologic test results. Indicate type and degree of 
                                    hearing loss for the frequency range from 500 to 4000 Hz.  For type of 
                                    loss, indicate whether it is normal, conductive, sensorineural, 
                                    central, or mixed.  For degree, indicate whether it is mild (26-40 dB 
                                    HL), moderate (41-54 dB HL), moderately-severe (55-69 dB HL), severe 
                                    (70-89  dB HL), or profound (90+ dB HL). For VA purposes, impaired 
                                    hearing is considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold 
                                    in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz is 40 dB 
                                    HL or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of 
                                    these frequencies are 26 dB HL or greater; or when speech recognition 
                                    scores are less than 94%.  
                                 
                                 2. Note whether, based on audiologic results, medical follow-up is needed 
                                    for an ear or hearing problem, and whether there is a problem that, if 
                                    treated, might cause a change in hearing threshold levels.
