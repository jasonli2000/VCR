This file contains a description of all of the interfaces with other packages.  The form will invoke the proper interface routines by doing a lookup on this file and then calling the routine by indirection. The Data will be exchanged between the
encounter form utilities and other packages by putting the data in at @IBARY. Interfaces that pass a single value or record will will reference data as in: S DATA=@IBARY. Interfaces that pass lists of records or values will reference the data as in: S
DATA=@IBARY@(<number of item on the list>).  
 
Note that multiple entries in this file can have the same entry points into routines. This is for efficiency purposes. For example, patient name, DOB and sex are all located on the same node of the Patient file. Each of these items of data can have its
own entry in the Package Interface file, but by using the same entry point there is a savings because all of the data on that node can be obtained at once. The routine that invokes the entry points keeps track of those already invoked so that they are
not repeated.

                                sense to allow a multiple choice question to point to vitals, which is used to input data such as temperature and blood pressure.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 'Yes' if you want to map entries from this interface to the clinical lexicon 
              DESCRIPTION:      If this field is answered 'Yes' then users who are editing or creating selection lists based on this interface will be asked to map each entry (thought it is optional) to a clinical lexicon entry.  This is highly 
                                recommended for user who are scanning diagnosis entries and trying to add entries to the Patients Problem list.  
                                 
                                The primary purpose of this field is to allow sites who have built selection lists using the ICD9 Diagnosis file to map each entry to the clinical lexicon.  The Problem List EP has recommended that each problem added to
                                the problem list be associated with a clinical lexicon entry.

                                perhaps the code.  2) Set IBLABEL to a suitable label for the choice.  3) Set IBID to an identifier. The identifier should ideally be exportable, meaning the same from site to site. This usually means a coded value rather
                                than an ien. The identfier should match that of a corresponding selection interface, if there is one.

                                This field should only be completed for input package interfaces.  This code will be executed to provide quick data entry for a user trying to input data for a form.  It is expected that the output of this field will be

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter Yes if the Data Qualifier should be passed as the Value when sending data to PCE. 
              DESCRIPTION:      If the value of the Data Qualifier shall be passed to PCE as the VALUE, this field should be set to one.  Doing so will prevent the data in the VALUE from populating the PCE DIM NODE, but instead, will allow the Data 
                                Qualifier to pass as the VALUE.  This is used mostly for YES/NO Data Qualifiers, where the value may be a question, and the Data Qualifier Value, if bubbled, is the value that must be placed on the PCE DIM NODE.

              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field should be populated when the PCE DIM PIECE VALUE is not constant.  If the value of that field is dependent upon specific conditions, those conditions may be evaluated by placing the MUMPS code in this field. 
                                Ultimately, the code should return a value that will be used as the PCE DIM PIECE VALUE.  If the return value is null, the original PCE DIM PIECE VALUE field will be used to determine the piece location to pass the VALUE
                                on.
