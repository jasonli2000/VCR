              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the date and time the treatment was provided. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the date and time the treatment was given by the provider.  This date and time may be different from the visit date and time.  For example, for clinic appointment visits, the visit date and time is the date and
                                time of the appointment, not the time the provider performed the clinical event.  
                                 
                                The date may be an imprecise date.  
                                 
                                Date and time may be within 30 days before or after the visit date, with the restriction the date cannot be a future date.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE User Interface, which allows manual entry of data, will be the prmary source of the event date and time.  The event date prompt defaults to the visit date and the time is entered to reflect the actual time the exam
                                was given. The event date does not have to be the visit date, but it must be within 30 days before or after the visit, and not be a future date.  
                                 
                                If a user wants to enter an historical measurement, the user should use the Historical Encounter entry action to document the historical measurement. Historical entries will not be eligible for credit.  
                                 
                                PCE data sources for automatic (scanning) data capture will be blank unless the event date and time are passed to PCE for filing.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is populated automatically by the PCE filing logic.  The format of the field is as follows:  Pointer to PCE data source file_"-"_A for Add or E for Edit_" "_DUZ of the person who entered the data_";"...  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE filing logic requires a pointer to the PCE data source file.  If this is not passed, then PCE filing logic will not process the data.  
                                 
                                If the record is a new record, then an "A" is used to specify the source that added the data.  If the record existed previously, PCE filing logic compares the old and new records of information.  An "E" will automatically
                                be used if the filing logic finds the data has been edited.  If "E" is used, then the Edited Flag field is automatically set to 1.  
                                 
                                The DUZ is stored in its internal format to represent the user who performed the adding or editing of data for this record.  
                                 
                                Iterations of editing will be concatenated to the previous data source value, up to 85 characters.

                                help determine clinical terminology definitions in the future.
