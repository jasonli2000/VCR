This file holds all MAS accepted/approved movement types.  All entries in you FACILITY MOVEMENT TYPE FILE (file 405.1) must point to an entry in this file.  This file is distributed by MAS and should NOT be altered by any facility.  Altering this file
can severely corrupt the integrity of your bed control movement options.  The internal entry numbers of this file are used by various packages to determine the processing necessary.  These numbers and entries must remain as distributed by the MAS
package.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the internal entry number as created by VA FileMan and maintained by the MAS package.  This number is used widely throughout many DHCP packages including MAS, dietetics, and pharmacy to determine 
                                programming flow.  Adding, editing, or removing entries in this file will have severe negative impacts on software operation at your facility.  You MUST NOT edit this data!

                                MAS software upgrades.  Changes to this file could severely impact operations at your site.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the transaction type of this MAS movement. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains a pointer to the MAS MOVEMENT TRANSACTION TYPE file containing the allowable types of bed control movements (admissions, discharges, transfers, lodger movements, etc.).  This data is distributed by the
                                MAS package under the direction of MAS VACO and the MAS SIUG.  Altering of this data in any way will have severe and negative impacts on operations at your site.

                                '1' FOR YES; 
              LAST EDITED:      MAR 25, 1991 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Should the user be prompted to change the treating specialty when entering this movement type? 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field will contain a yes if, when entering a movement of this type, the user should also be asked if they would like to enter a specialty transfer.  This would only be true in the case of admissions and some 
                                transfers.  This data is distributed with the MAS package under the direction of the MAS SIUG and MAS VACO.  Altering of this data in any way will have severe and negative impacts on operations at your site.

              LAST EDITED:      AUG 02, 1990 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Should user be prompted for the name of the facility to/from which the patient is received/sent? 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field will contain a yes if, when entering a movement of this type, the user should also be asked for a 'TRANSFER FACILITY'.  This would be true for movements such as TRANSFER IN, TRANSFER OUT, CONTINUED ASIH (OTHER
                                FACILITY), etc. where it is necessary to prompt for the facility where the patient is trasferring from or to.  This data is distributed by the MAS package as directed by MAS VACO and the MAS SIUG.  Altering of this data in
                                any way will have severe and negative impacts on operations at your site.

              LAST EDITED:      AUG 02, 1990 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Can this movement type be selected by the user or is it generated by the module? 
              DESCRIPTION:      Due to the ASIH (absent sick in hospital) functionality, there are certain movements (a TO ASIH admission) which are entered automatically by the system and are not selectable.  In this case, MODULE GENERATED would be 
                                entered in this field.  For movements which the user can choose at standard TYPE OF MOVEMENT prompts, this field will be SELECTABLE.  This data is distributed by the MAS package as directed by the MAS SIUG and MAS VACO.  
                                Altering of this data in any way will have severe and negative impacts on operations at your site.

                                '7' FOR DEATH WITHOUT AUTOPSY; 
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 25, 1992 
              HELP-PROMPT:      For this discharge movement type, enter the PTF code to be used for this transaction. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is filled in only for discharges and contains the code for the discharge that is transmitted with the PTF record.  This data is distributed by the MAS packge under the direction of the MAS SIUG and MAS VACO. 
                                Altering of this data in any way will have severe and negative impacts on the operations of MAS and other DHCP software packages.

405.2,10      CAN ONLY FOLLOW MOVEMENT(S) F;0 POINTER Multiple #405.21

              DESCRIPTION:      This multiple contains all other types of movements which this entry is allowed to follow.  For admissions, this multiple will be blank as they can not follow any other movements.  This is also true for check-in lodger 
                                movements.  This multiple will never contain discharges or check-out lodger movements as nothing can follow them.  The 'can only follow' syntax holds only for a single episode:  either a lodger episode or an admission 
                                episode.  
                                 
                                This data is distributed by the MAS software package under the direction and review of MAS VACO as well as the MAS expert panel.  Editing of entries in this multiple will have severe and extremely negative affects on the 
                                operation of the MAS software package as well as other DHCP software packages.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field contains a movement which this MAS MOVEMENT TYPE can follow.  No discharges or check-out lodger movements will be contained in this multiple and there will be no entries in the multiple for MAS MOVEMENT TYPES
                                  which are admissions or check-in lodgers.  Altering of this data in any way (adding, editing, or deleting) WILL have severe and negative impacts on the operations of MAS as well as other DHCP software packages.
