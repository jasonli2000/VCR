                  Description:  Before deleting a record from this file, save a copy of it in file 403.56.  Deletion can be either because a clerk deletes a patient from the recall list, or because a patient has been given an appointment in a clinic
                                requested by the recall list and therefore is deleted by the nightly job.  We save this information so that we can look back at appointments given to patients and see how timely the appointments were.
