This file contains the scoring keys.  The scoring keys are the "answer sheet" for the specified scale entry in the MH SCALES file (#601.87). When an answer matches the Target value (ie, is correct) a specified value is added to the score.  An example
would be: if the question is "How much is 5 plus 3", the target value would be 8 and 10 points would be added to the total score (grade) in a ten question test to make a possible score of 100.
