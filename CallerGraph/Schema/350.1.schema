              DESCRIPTION:      This field tells the IB filer the order in which to file entries with AR.  A new entry must be filed before it can be cancelled.  An update action type will generate two actions, a cancel of previous entry, and an updated
                                entry containing the correct data.  The update will be filed after the cancel.  The ordering must be maintained so that the last full entry in the INTEGRATED BILLING ACTION file for a parent is the most current entry.  (an
                                inverse date x-ref on the parent field will indicate the most recent entry to the updated parent) Additional numbering series are also available for IB ACTION TYPES which do not explicitly represent billable charges. 
                                These series are set so that they do not conflict with the ordering required for correct processing of IB ACTION charges in AR.
