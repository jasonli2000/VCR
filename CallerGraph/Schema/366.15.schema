This file is used to support NCPDP billing for multiple Rate Types.  Entries are created in this file based on the prescription and fill/refill number.  The Rate Type determined at time of Billing Determination is stored in this file so it can be
utilized when bill creation occurs.  This file is also used to store the associated copayment reference number if a non-veteran copayment charge is created to allow easy lookup if the copayment charge needs to be cancelled.  
 
 
Per VHA Directive 2004-038, this file definition should not be modified.
