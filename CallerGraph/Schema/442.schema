              LAST EDITED:      JUN 27, 1994 
              DESCRIPTION:      This multiple will hold the  dollar amount for each BOC within this file 442 record.  
                                   
                                Longer explanation.  The BOC field in this multiple allows the selection of one of the ITEM multiple BOC.  Only the BOC listed in the "D" x-ref found within the ITEM multiple in this record, are allowable choices for the
                                BOC multiple.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This multiple, along with the BOC field in the ITEM multiple, handles the task of keeping track of which items belong to each FMS LINE entry.  
                                   
                                The "D" x-ref on the BOC field, field 3.5, in the ITEM multiple is used with the BOC field, field .01, in this multiple to limit the selection only to entries in this record.  
                                   
                                The "AH" x-ref on the same field in the ITEM multiple allows for the lookup of all items using the same BOC.  
                                   
                                The SUBAMOUNT field in this multiple just keeps the total dollar amount for each BOC, as reported to FMS.  
                                   
                                The FMS LINE field just keeps track of the number sent to FMS when the subamount was sent down to FMS.  
                                   
                                To find all the ITEM entries used to gather the SUBAMOUNT value for any BOC in this multiple just look through the "AH" x-ref in the ITEM multiple.

     Center (AAC). It is set up so that users of the delivery orders menu can
     use suggested defaults. By design, these delivery orders use source code =
     6. The PRCB and PRCCB are used to keep track of the competitive status for
     the PO and decide to present the field 'Reason not competed' to the user.
