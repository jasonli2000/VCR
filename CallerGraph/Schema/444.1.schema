This file contains vendors used in the RFQ process who are not found in the site's main VENDOR file (#440).  Once a vendor is selected as the source during RFQ award, an entry for him should be made in file #440 so that he will be vendorized by the
Austin Automation Center and be ready for payment transactions.  In lookups for vendors in the RFQ module, file #440 is first searched for the vendor.  If the vendor is not found, the search continues in file #444.1.  If not present in this file, the
user has the option to add a vendor to this file.
