This file contains a list of Orderable Items that should have a reminder definition or a reminder  term evaluation run against them as an order check.  The Orderable Item will only be evaluated when the user places the order in CPRS. An Orderable Item
Group can contain a list of Orderable Items and a list of Rules. A reminder rule can only contain one reminder term or one reminder definition.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field is a pointer to file #811.9. If a reminder definition is defined in this field when an order is placed in CPRS, the reminder definition will be evaluated. The reminder definition evaluation will return an
