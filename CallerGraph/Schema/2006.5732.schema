The entries in this table are the result-sets that are created in response to DICOM Query/Retrieve requests that may be processed through Remote Procedure Calls.  
 
Each entry in this table is one such result-set.  
 
Result-sets are kept in this table, so that client-stations can call Remote Procedures to obtain the content of a result-set in portions of a limited size.  
 
Also, since the creation of a result-set may need more time than is reasonable wait for in a single Remote Procedure Call, the existence of this table makes it possible to call a first Remote Procedure to create the result-set through a TaskMan process 
and then call subsequent Remote Procedures to inquire whether the result-set is complete, and subsequently to obtain the results.

              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a code that indicates the status of a query.  
                                 
                                When a query is initiated, the value of this field will be set to IP = In Progress.  
                                 
                                When a query is complete, the value of this field will be changed to OK = Query Complete.  
                                 
                                When all results that are logged for the query have been reported, the value of this field will be set to X = Query Completely Reported, so that a clean-up process may remove the now obsolete result-set.

              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a timestamp that indicates when a result-set was last accessed.  
                                 
                                This value is set to the current date and time when the result-set is first marked as complete, and will be updated each time a (partial) result is reported.  
                                 
                                The main purpose of this field to to assist a maintenance process in cleaning up result-sets that haven't been accessed in more than a couple of days.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the DICOM tag (xxxx,xxxx) for the current value. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string that represents a DICOM tag.  A DICOM tag consists of two pairs of 4 hexadecimal digits, separated by a comma.  
                                   
                                  The DICOM tag qualifies the meaning of the data-value that is stored in the rest of the current record.

                                This number will be used to query TaskMan to see whether the background process has completed.  
                                 
                                Note: if the background process is no longer active, and no result-set has been delivered, the error log should be checked for any problems.
