              DESCRIPTION:      This is the date of the Review.  Normally, reviews are done for UR purposes on days 3, 6, 9, 14, 21, 28 and every 7 days thereafter.  This field contains the date of these reviews.  
                                 
                                There are 2 related fields,  DAY FOR REVIEW, and DATE ENTERED.  The field DAY FOR REVIEW will generally be computed for you based on the REVIEW DATE.  The DATE ENTERED is the date the review was entered into the computer
                                and is automatically generated for you.  
                                 
                                Normally the REVIEW DATEs are done in order. The pre-cert or urgent admission review is done before the continued stay reviews which in turn are normally done before the Discharge review.  The order of reviews shown on the
                                main review screen is based on REVIEW DATE.
