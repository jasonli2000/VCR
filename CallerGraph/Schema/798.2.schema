The ROR SELECTION RULES file contains definitions of the selection rules that are used to screen patients for addition to the registries. There are two kinds of rules: top-level and lower level.  
 
If a rule is referenced by the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file, it is the top-level rule.  Non-zero value of any top-level rule expression directly determines that the patient should be added to the corresponding registry.  
 
Lower level rules are referenced only by other rules (by rule macros in the expressions). Their expressions are evaluated in the proper order, and the result values are used in the expressions of other rules. Lower level rules have an indirect impact on
the final result and can be used for complex processing of linked files and multiples.  
 
For example, a lower level rule can calculate maximum and minimum values of a parameter in the sub-file, and a top-level rule will analyze these values and decide if the patient should be added to the registry. Moreover, they could be used to split a
very complex rule into several simpler rules.  
 
Records of the file are uniquely identified by the rule name (the "A" primary key and the uniqueness index "B" are used for this purpose).

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  MUMPS expression that implements the selection rule can contain special macros:

                                 {I: Field Number} 
                                 
                                 {Rule Name} - Result value of the lower level selection rule 
                                 
                                 {AVG: Rule Name} - Average value of the rule 
                                 
                                 {CNT: Rule Name} - Number of calculations of the rule 
                                 
                                 {MAX: Rule Name} - Maximum value of the rule 
                                 
                                 {MIN: Rule Name} - Minimum value of the rule 
                                 
                                 {SUM: Rule Name} - Total of the selection rule values 
                                 
                                 {LS: Lab Search Name} - This macro can be used only in the selection rules associated with the LAB DATA file (#63). It is evaluated as 1 if some of the patient lab results pass the Lab search criteria (from the file 
                                #798.9). Otherwise, it is evaluated as zero.  
                                 
                                Return values of the top-level rules: 
                                 
                                 0        - Skip the patient 
                                 Non-zero - Add the patient to the registry 
                                 
                                Return values of the lower level rules: 
                                 
                                Return values can be used in the expressions of the other rules. Some additional values are calculated automatically (minimum, maximum, average, etc.) for each rule.  
                                 
                                Avoid circular references in the expressions. If a rule directly or indirectly depends on itself, it cannot be evaluated. An example of the circular reference: 
                                 
                                 Rule A: {MAX:B}<10 
                                 Rule B: {I:23}+{C} 
                                 Rule C: {CNT:A} 
                                 
                                The rule A cannot be evaluated because it depends on the rule B, which depends on rule C, and C depends on A.  
                                 
                                Complex selection rules could be implemented by external MUMPS functions. In that case the expression should contains a full reference to the function ($$TAG^ROUTINE). Values of the necessary data elements can be loaded
                                automatically (see description of the DATA ELEMENT multiple).  
                                 
                                See the Programmer's reference manual for more details regarding the selection rule expressions.
