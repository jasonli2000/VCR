This file tracks Blood Bank data integrity issues for the following files: Patient (#2) and Lab Data (#63).  
 
These issues are checked during the pre-implementation phase of the Blood Bank data conversion.  A record is kept so the Blood Bank ADPACs can resolve those issues logged, so clean data can be moved into SQL tables.
