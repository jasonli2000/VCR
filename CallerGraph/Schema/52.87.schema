This file (#52.87) is used to capture TRICARE/CHAMPVA bypass and override audit information for Outpatient Pharmacy related prescriptions. The bypass function circumvents ePharmacy processing for TRICARE/CHAMPVA eligible inpatients. The override function
allows continued processing of prescriptions for non-billable products for TRICARE/CHAMPVA eligible outpatients as well as prescriptions that reject.
