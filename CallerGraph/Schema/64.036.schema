This file is used to store extracted DSS clinical data. The calling application is responsible for purging the data before and after a call is made to the laboratory API routine LRCAPDAR.  
 
The structure and contents of this file is to support DSS extraction of specific clinical values to monitor patient treatment effectiveness.  
 
This file is not for local use and should only be used by the DSS calling application.  
 
This file is solely for DSS utilization.  
 
Criteria for data extraction of clinical values is specified the DSS LAB TESTS (#727.2) file. The file is populated by the DSS Coordinator with the advise of the Laboratory Information Manager (LIM). Populating DSS LAB TESTS file without the approval of
the LIM will lead to unexpected or unreliable data extraction performance.  
 
Normally there is no residual data stored in this file and journaling is not required.
