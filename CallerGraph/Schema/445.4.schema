This file is used to describe storage locations within any Generic Inventory Point (i.e. the Bins, Shelves, Rooms, etc. in which supplies are stored).  The format for creating codes related to a storage location can be defined by each inventory point to
meet their own needs.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the section, row, bin, shelf, etc. by which you store items, from largest to smallest division.  ANSWER MUST BE 1-13 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH 
              DESCRIPTION:      This file is used by the Generic Inventory Package.  Storage locations can be defined by each Inventory Point for their own use.  An example of a storage location could be a Room no., Bin location, Shelf, etc.  NOTE:
                                Several reports (picking document, issue books, etc.) use the storage location as a sort field.  In order to sort correctly, make sure that numeric fields are zero filled to the number of characters in the largest value
                                for the field.  Ex. for a storage location with section 1 to 50, bins 1 to 100, shelves 1 to 6, a storage location of section 5, bin 2, shelf 3 would be 05-002-3.

                                This cross reference sets the INVENTORY/DISTRIBUTION POINT field (#1) to the inventory point creating the storage location.  The variable PRCPINPT must be set to the internal inventory point number prior to adding a new
                                entry.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the name of the Inventory point that entered this storage location.  The field is used to 'screen' so that each inventory point can use their own discreet set of storage locations. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a pointer to the Generic Inventory File, #445.  This field contains the name of the Inventory point that entered the storage location.  It also is used for screening purposes (i.e., each inventory point can use
                                their own discrete set of storage locations).
