This file stores the Clinical Reminder taxonomies. A taxonomy is a way to give a name to a set of codes. The codes that can be used in a taxonomy are ICD Diagnosis (ICD 9), ICD Operation/Procedure (ICD 0), and CPT.  
 
This file contains a combination of nationally distributed and local entries. Nationally distributed entries have their name prefixed with VA- and their Class is National. Local entry names cannot start with VA- or have a National Class.
