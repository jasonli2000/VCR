This file stores the Clinical Reminders taxonomies. Taxonomies are used as Clinical Reminders findings and provide a way to define a set of codes as a single finding. Taxonomies are structured so that any of the coding systems defined in Lexicon's Coding
System (file #757.03) can be used. However, in order for a coding system to be used in Clinical Reminders, there must be a source in VistA where the coded patient data is stored. Examples are V POV (file #9000010.07) which stores ICD diagnosis codes and
PTF (file #45) which stores ICD diagnosis and procedure codes. The coding systems that meet this criteria are listed for selection in the taxonomy editor.  
 
This file contains a combination of nationally distributed and local entries. Nationally distributed entries have their names prefixed with VA- and their Class is National. Local entry names cannot start with VA- or have a National Class.

                                Any combination of these letters can be used. For example, 'A' would limit the search to acute problems. 'CU' would include chronic problems and those whose priority is undefined. If this field is left blank then all
                                priorities will be included.

                DESCRIPTION:      TERM/CODE along with a Coding System are passed to the Lexicon search utility, which returns a list of codes based on the user's search criteria. Terms are descriptions for a concept and the code is a unique identifier
                                  assigned to that description. A concept can have one or more descriptions to express the concept. An example of this in SNOMED is the concept code 271807003 that has a fully specified name of "Eruption of Skin", a
                                  preferred name of "Eruption" and several synonyms: "Rash", "Skin Eruption", "Skin Rash". For more information, see the Lexicon Utility User Manual.
