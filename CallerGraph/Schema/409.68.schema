 This file contains all outpatient encounters since 10/1/93 that have been 
 successfully checked out or need to be checked out. The types of 
 encounters that caused entries to be added to this file are appointments, 
 add/edit stop codes and dispositions.  
 
 If the encounter needs to be checked out then it will have a status 
 of 'PENDING ACTION'. The site will not receive workload credit if 
 the status remains 'PENDING ACTION'.  'PENDING ACTION' includes both 
 'ACTION REQUIRED' and 'NO ACTION TAKEN' statuses.  
 
 If the encounter has been no-showed or cancelled then it will NOT be 
 in this file.  
 
 Inpatient encounters will always have a status of 'INPATIENT APPOINTMENT'.  
 
 Appointments made for non-count clinics will always have a status of 
 'NON-COUNT'.  
 
 All other encounters will have a status of 'CHECKED OUT'.

                                                  time of the conversion. The node did not exist because it 
                                                  had been purged. The conversion set and then killed the
