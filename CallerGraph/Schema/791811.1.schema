This file contains the product groups for line items that may be ordered from the Denver Distribution Center through the Remote Order/Entry System. Each item in the Remote Inventory Product File has an assigned product group.  This file controls the
ability of individuals at the station level to order an item. (e.g., Only the staff of ASPS will be able to order hearing aids)  All data in this file is distributed with the ROES. The file should not be edited by the local facility.
