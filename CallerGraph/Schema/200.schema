                                The XUNOTRIG flag controls whether this cross-reference is executed. The form XUEXISTING USER and the XUNEW USER forms both set the XUNOTRIG flag, because the forms themselves contain the logic necessary to keep the two 
                                files in synch.  
                                 
                                XUITNAME is set by the XUEXISTING USER and XUNEW USER forms and is checked by the input transform on the .01 field. If XUITNAME is set, the input transform returns in the XLFNC array the component parts of the name. This 
                                MUMPS cross-reference can then get the name components from the XLFNC array to populate the Name Components file.

              DESCRIPTION:      This subfile stores the information that travels along with visitors using the CPRS Foreign Views software to look at medical data of a patient which resides on a system where the visitor may not have valid access or
                                verify codes.  When that person name and Social Security Number is put into the visited system's New Person File this multiple is updated to provide the ability to trace the visitors back to the system from which they are 
                                visiting.  This field (.01) stores the number of the site where the visitor was authenticated.

  Record Indexes:

  ATR (#228)    RECORD    MUMPS    IR    SORTING ONLY
      Short Descr:  This index keeps track of records for which clinical trainee data is edited.
      Description:  This new-style cross-reference has as cross-reference values all the fields in the NEW PERSON file that are being tracked by the Office of Academic Affiliations for rollup into a centralized database. When any of the fields are
                    edited, the cross-reference logic will set an index entry that corresponds to the edited record. The index entries will look like this: 
                     
                      ^VA(200,"ATR",ien) = FM internal date 
                     
                    "ATR" stands for "ATRainee." 
                     
                    None of the field-type cross-reference values are used as subscripts in the index, since we are only interested in recording the IENs of the records that are edited and the date the index entry is set. A separate queuable option will
                    loop through the entries in this index, and send via HL7 messages the clinical trainee data of each record to the Office of Academic Affiliations.  
                     
                    Note that the index will only be set if the person is a Clinical Trainee, that is, if the PROGRAM OF STUDY (#12.2) field is filled in.
