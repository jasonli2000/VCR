This file is used by the reminder reports options only. For each type of report (e.g. Reminders Due), selection parameters used in a report may be saved as a template when the report is being run. When running reports, the user may opt to retrieve
parameters from an existing template as the basis of a new report. Templates may be modified, renamed, copied, or deleted from the reminder report options.  
 
The parameters for the reminder reports consist of a patient sample (e.g.  PCMM team) from which a patient list is built and also a list of reminders to be evaluated for each selected patient.  
 
The field names in the template file correspond to the local variable and array names used in the print routines.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Routine PXRMXT loads templates into a local array for use by the report routines. Each patient sample has only one associated array. The field PXRMSEL decides which array is loaded. The local arrays correspond to the field
                                names in the template file.  
                                 
                                e.g. PXRMSEL="I" patient entries in field PXRMPAT are loaded into array PXRMPAT PXRMSEL="T" team entries in field PXRMPCM are loaded into array PXRMPCM PXRMSEL="P" providers in field PXRMPRV are loaded into array PXRMPRV 
                                PXRMSEL="O" team entries in PXRMOTM are loaded into array PXRMOTM 
                                 
                                Note that except for the individual patient sample (PXRMSEL="I") the template file does not hold patient identifiers. Lists of patients are assembled by the report routines.
