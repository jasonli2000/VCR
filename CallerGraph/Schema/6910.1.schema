Used by package specific device selection logic to assist users in identifying output devices. As a rule, only hardcopy print devices should be contained in this file. The intent is to discourage users from inadvertently sending output to a CRT or some
other device not intended for printing. 
 
This file also contains device-specific instructions for customized formats and data layouts for use when printing bar coded equipment and location labels from AEMS/MERS. It is quite conceiveable for more than one entry in the Engineering Computer Port
file to point to the same entry in the Device file (#3.5), the difference could be the bar code instructions.

              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code, not to exceed 245 characters. 
              DESCRIPTION:      There should be an entry for this field if and only if this device is used to print bar coded equipment labels using a customized format.  Entries must contain no more then 245 characters of executable M code.  
                                 
                                If this device does not require formatting, just enter a 'Q' as the BAR CODE EQUIPMENT FORMAT field and no formatting instructions will be sent.  
                                 
                                If the device does require formatting (and most thermal transfer bar code printers do) and you wish to customize it, then you are advised to enter the name of a formatting program segment in the form 'D EQFRMAT^ENZLBL'
                                where program segment EQFRMAT^ENZLBL contains the M code that sends your formatting commands (for equipment labels) to the printer.  
                                 
                                If there is no entry in this field and the device is used to print bar coded equipment labels, then the standard formatting instructions will be issued automatically. These commands are found in program segment
                                FORMAT1^ENLBL7 and were designed for the Intermec 8600 series of thermal transfer bar code printers. 
                                 
                                At the time that the formatting program segment is called, this device will be open as the 'current device'.

              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code, no more than 245 char long. 
              DESCRIPTION:      There should be an entry for this field if and only if this device is used to print bar coded location labels using a customized format. Entries must contain no more then 245 characters of executable M code. 
                                 
                                If this device does not require formatting, just enter a 'Q' as the BAR CODE LOCATION FORMAT field and no formatting instructions will be sent.  
                                 
                                If the device does require formatting (and most thermal transfer bar code printers do) and you wish to customize it, then you are advised to enter the name of a formatting program segment in the form 'D LOCFRMAT^ENZLBL' 
                                where program segment LOCFRMAT^ENZLBL contains the M code that sends your formatting commands to this printer.  
                                 
                                If there is no entry in this field and the device is used to print bar coded location labels, then the standard formatting instructions will be issued automatically. These commands are found in program segment 
                                FORMAT1^ENLBL7 and were designed for the Intermec 8600 series of thermal transfer bar code printers.

              LAST EDITED:      OCT 10, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code, not to exceed 245 characters. 
              DESCRIPTION:      There should be an entry for this field if and only if this device is used to print bar coded equipment labels including a customized arrangement of fields from within the Equipment file (#6914). Entries must contain no 
                                more than 245 characters of executable M code.  
                                 
                                If there is no entry in this field and the device is used to print bar coded equipment labels, then the standard field layout will be used automatically. The standard field layout includes the equipment entry number and
                                facility name in human readable format. Sites may use the Engineering Site Parameters Enter/Edit option [ENSITE] to have the name of the EQUIPMENT CATEGORY (if any) included at the top of the equipment label. This option
                                also allows sites to print one or two equipment fields of their own choosing in human readable format instead of the facility name.  
                                 
                                Sites wishing to do more customization than that allowed by the Engineering Site Parameters Enter/Edit option are free to write their own print routines using M code and enter the appropriate calling point (in the form 'D
                                EQDATA^ENZLBL') in this BAR CODE EQUIPMENT DATA field.  
                                 
                                       NOTE: If there is an entry for BAR CODE EQUIPMENT DATA then the 
                                             standard field layout will not be invoked.  
                                 
                                At the time that the user-defined print routine is called, this device will be open as the 'current device' and local variable DA will be set to the equipment entry number.

              DESCRIPTION:      There should be an entry for this field if and only if this device is used to print bar coded location labels using a customized arrangement of fields from within the Space file (#6928). Entries must contain no more than
                                30 characters of executable M code.  
                                 
                                If there is no entry in this field and the device is used to print bar coded location labels, then the standard field layout will be used automatically. The standard field layout includes the physical location (as
                                ROOM-BUILDING-DIVISION) and facility name in human readable format.  Sites may use the Engineering Site Parameters Enter/Edit option [ENSITE] to have the name of the SPACE FUNCTION (if any) printed at the top of the
