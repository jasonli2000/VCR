              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is a placeholder.  It is expected that the application will point to another file, and that this field will be redefined as a pointer to that file.

                                The field description indicates that this field may be changed to a pointer.  For the present, this index will be used for lookup by application, and to facilitate identifying an appropriate (re)processing routine for the
                                exception.
