              DESCRIPTION:      This designates what type of fileman template is utilized to perform functions or displays/outputs through the ADT DHCP application software.  The forms of templates are as follows: 
                                      INPUT - requires user input into the software to enter or edit 
                                              current information.  
                                     OUTPUT - In most cases, the user designates a date range or other 
                                              range to print, and an output is sent to a designated 
                                              printer.  
                                       SORT - A sort template is created through fileman and allows the 
                                              user to search for information based on various demon- 
                                              inators, i.e. sort for all inpatients by ward and within 
                                              ward, sort by room-bed number.  This will give a listing 
                                              of all inpatients, listed by ward and notes what room-bed 
                                              they are occupying.
