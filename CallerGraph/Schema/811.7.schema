This file contains Reminder Categories. Reminder Categories are created at each site and are not released with the reminder package.  
 
A Reminder Category is a list of reminders (or other reminder categories) and is used to group reminders for display in the CPRS GUI. Reminder categories are allocated to individual users, locations, service or system using the option PXRM CPRS LOOKUP 
CATEGORIES.  
 
Reminder Categories can also be used in conjunction with Reminder Due Summary Reports. The user is given the option to select a Reminder Category or input a list of individual reminders.
