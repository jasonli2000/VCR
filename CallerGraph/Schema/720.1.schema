This file is used to update when the Event Capture software is installed. It is used during the post installation process to track previous package installation information. In Version 2.0, the post installation routine sets entry number one (1) and the
date and time the post installation routine ran to completion. This information is used for future reference. Version 2.0 requires extensive data conversion if a previous pilot version of this software is resident at site. 
 
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan. This information is set during the package installation process.
