This file contains errors for billing functions.  It may be used by applications, IB or AR.  The normal format for a routine to return an error is to return the variable: 
  Y=1^... a successful event occured 
  Y=-1^error code[;error code;error code...]^additional text The error messages can be displayed by calling routine ^IBAERR.  If the error occurs in a tasked job ($D(ZTQUEUED)'=0) the routine will put the error message in a bulletin and post it to the
group defined in the IB SITE PARAMETER FILE.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
