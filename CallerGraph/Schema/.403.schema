                                that contains one form-only field that performs a pointer-type read into the Primary File of the form.  The Record Selection Page property should be set equal to the Page Number of the Record Selection Page.  
                                 
                                The user can open the Record Selection Page by pressing <PF1>L.  After the user selects a record and closes the Record Selection Page, the data for the selected record is displayed.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the coordinate of the upper left corner of the page.  Answer must be two positive integers separated by a comma (,), as follows:  'Upper left row,Upper left column'. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The Page Coordinate property defines the location of the top left corner of the page on the screen.  The format of a coordinate is:  Row,Column.  Regular pages normally have a Page Coordinate of  "1,1".  They do not have 
                                  a Lower Right Coordinate.  
                                   
                                  The Page Coordinate of pop-up pages defines the position of the top left corner of the border of the pop-up page.  Pop-up pages must have a Lower Right Coordinate, which defines the position of the bottom right corner of 
                                  the border of the pop-up page.  
                                   
                                  All blocks on the page are positioned relative to the page on which they are defined.  If a page is moved -- that is, if the Page Coordinate is changed -- all blocks and all fields on that page move with it.

                DESCRIPTION:      Enter the page to go to when the user presses <PF1><Down> or selects the NEXT PAGE command from the Command Line.  
                                   
                                  When the user attempts a Save, ScreenMan follows the Next Page links starting with the first page displayed to the user.  ScreenMan loads all those pages, including any defaults, and checks that all required fields have
                                  values.  If any of the required fields have null values, no Save occurs.  If all required field have values, Screenman Saves the data, including all defaults.

                DESCRIPTION:      If the page is a pop-up page rather than a regular page, set this property to 'YES'.  
                                   
                                  ScreenMan displays pop-up pages with a border, on top of what is already on the screen.  The top left coordinate of the pop-up page defines the location of the top left corner of the border.  Pop-up pages must also have
                                  a lower right coordinate, which defines the location of the bottom left corner of the border.

                DESCRIPTION:
                                  The existence of a lower right coordinate implies that the page is a pop-up page.  The lower right coordinate and the page coordinate define the position of the border ScreenMan displays when it paints a pop-up page.

                DESCRIPTION:      Like the Page Number, you can use the Page Name to refer to a page in ScreenMan functions and utilities.  ScreenMan displays the Page Name to the user if, during an attempt to file data, ScreenMan finds required fields
                                  with null values.  ScreenMan uses the Caption of the field and the Page Name to inform the user of the location of the required field.

                                    '0' FOR NO;

                  LAST EDITED:      MAY 05, 1994 
                  DESCRIPTION:
                                    If set to YES, this prohibits the user from entering new subentries into the multiple.  If null or set to NO, the setting in the data dictionary determines whether LAYGO is allowed.

                  LAST EDITED:      MAY 06, 1994 
                  HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-30 characters in length. 
                  DESCRIPTION:      This is the field order of the field that defines the column position of the blank line at the end of the list.  The default is the first editable field in the block.  This is also the field before which ScreenMan
                                    prints the plus sign (+) to indicate there are more entries above or below the displayed list.

                  LAST EDITED:      APR 20, 1999 
                  DESCRIPTION:      Answer 'YES' to ask the user whether the looked-up entry is 'OK'. If only one match is made to the user's lookup value, then ScreenMan will ask "OK?" instead of automatically selecting the found entry. This property 
                                    corresponds to the "V" flag in the DIC(0) input variable to ^DIC and only pertains to multiple-valued fields.
