              DESCRIPTION:      This is the internal representation of a given IIV status which may be found in the Insurance Buffer application.  This code takes into account that although several IIV statuses may use the same symbol in the IIV status
                                column in the Insurance Buffer list, each IIV status may have a different meaning.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 32 and 126, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is the ASCII number representation for the character which should be displayed in the IIV status column in the insurance buffer list for this entry.  The ASCII value is being stored instead of the character
                                itself because of the issues involved with storing the "?" character as a valid symbol.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Can the Expand Entry action overwrite this IIV status? 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field will determine whether or not the IIV status associated with a buffer entry may get overwritten by the Expand Entry action in the Insurance Buffer application.  Some IIV statuses should stay as they are and not
                                get updated by Expand Entry and other symbols should get updated, so the user knows the current status of the buffer entry with regard to the IIV process.
