This file contains all the camera/equip/rm that may be used to perform imaging examinations.  The 'RADIOLOGY LOCATIONS' file uses this file to indicate which camera/eqip/rm are allowable choices when the technologist attaches a camera/equip/rm to an exam
s/he has performed.  In other words, when the procedure is performed on a patient at a location, the only valid choices are those cameras/equip/rms associated with that location.  
 
A camera/equip/rm can be associated with more than one location.  
 
Entries in this file should not be deleted. Adding new entries is always allowed.

system supports this function.
