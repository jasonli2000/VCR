This file contains the specifications for each patient id format.  Each entry in the ELIGIBILITY CODE file points to an entry in this file.  This relationship is used whenever a primary or other eligibility is assigned to a patient.  The ID FORMAT
associated with the assigned eligibility will be used to set the patient's long and short id.  
 
The default ID FORMAT is 'VA STANDARD'.  This format is the same as the SSN.  
 
Currently, spring of 1991, the only sites using formats other then VA STANDARD are those sites running VA/DOD software developed by the Dallas ISC.  
 
Those hospitals having VA/DOD sharing agreements may eventually add other format types to help identify DOD patients.  However, the site should contact its support ISC before adding any new formats.
