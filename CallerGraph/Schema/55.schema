This file holds, for each patient, information that is typically of interest only to the pharmacy.  This should be noted when merging patient records and deleting the 'old' record from the patient file.  That process does not delete the corresponding
pharmacy patient file entry.  
 
This file is also shared with inpatient pharmacy and promises to become a very central file to the pharmacy.

                                    times will print on the MAR or labels, and the PICK LIST will always show a count of zero (0). Avoid using notation such as W/F (with food) or WM (with meals) in the schedule as it may cause erroneous calculations. 
                                    That information should be entered into the SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS. When using the MO-WE-FR@AD schedule, please remember that this type of schedule will not work properly without the "@" character and at least one admin.
                                    time, and that at least the first two letters of each weekday entered is needed.

                DESCRIPTION:        Enter the rate at which the infusion is to take place.  This value, in conjunction with the total volume of the hyperal or the admixture type, is used to determine the time covered by one bag; hence the system can 
                                  predict the bags needed during a specified time of coverage. This field is free text for IVPB's.  For LVP's you must enter a number that will represent the infusion rate.  You may also specify the # of bags per day that
                                  will be needed.  
                                   
                                   Example: 125 = 125 ml/hr (IV system will calculate bags needed per day) 
                                          125@2 = 125 ml/hr with 2 labels per day 
                                      TITRATE@1 = TITRATE with 1 label per day 
                                   The format of this field is either a number only or 
                                   [FREE TEXT@NUMBER OF LABELS PER DAY].  
                                   
                                  Note:  If an administration time(s) is defined, the number of labels will reflect the administration time(s) for the IVPB type orders.  For example:  One administration time of 12:00 is specified.  The infusion rate is
                                  entered as 125@3.  Only 1 label will print.

                  DESCRIPTION:        'STRENGTH' is the amount of an additive that is used in the manufacturing of the IV order.  NOTE!  You'll be expected to use the strength units that have been previously defined within the additive file (52.6) for
                                    each additive.  That is to say, if the additive file expects AMPICILLIN to be dispensed in 'GMS', it would not be correct for you to enter '500' for a half-gram dose -- enter 0.5 instead.

                                            canceled, or destroyed in the same IV room from which it was dispensed.
