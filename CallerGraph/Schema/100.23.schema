Entries in this file with an internal number >1000 have been exported with the OE/RR package.  Everytime a new version of OE/RR is installed the entries above 1000 are removed and overwritten.  
 
If you want to use one of these exported entries, transfer the entry to a number less than 1000 and give it a new name so that it can be differentiated from the exported entry.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 3 and 132, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is specifically used in formats that use the Order Text field for displaying the order text within a format.  The value in this field is the length that the order text will use, and is the same value that is put
                                in the FORMAT field for the Order Text field definition.  The exported value is 36.  This value is necessary to correctly calculate the number of lines available for printing an order.  If you create a customized version
                                of this format, and you change the value of the FORMAT field for Order Text, make sure this field is also changed to match.
