This file is to allow the claims tracking module store the admitting physician.  In addition, the attending and resident providers can be identified in this file.  If attending and resident providers are entered then they are assume to be entered
completely for an episode of care being tracked.  If no provider other than admitting physician is entered then the providers and attending from MAS will be considered to the the correct providers.  Because QM data may be extracting this data on the
national roll-up, it is necessary to correctly identify the attending physician.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

                                It may be that the admitting physician is different from either the attending or provider.  If the admission to acure care does not meet UR criteria, it is important to track the admitting physician.  
                                 
                                The attending physician is the physician responsible for the care of the patient, more than one physician may be the attending.  
                                 
                                The provider is the physician directly providing patient care.  In affiliated hospitals this can be a resident or intern who is not necessarily responsible (the attending is responsible).  
                                 
                                Because UR reviews are done every day, it is important to be able to accurately track attendings and providers related to care that does not meet critea.
