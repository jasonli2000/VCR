This file contains the site specific parameters which are used by the Admission, Discharge and Transfer (ADT) modules.  The parameters are set by using the 'DGPAR' routine or the 'ADT Parameters' menu option.  The parameters are used to identify such
things as your facility hemodialysis unit, your admission/discharge/transfer types, your divisions (if multi-division facility) and the devices to which you desire your 10-10's, routing slips, etc., printed to.  The ADT parameters must be set prior to
running ADT.

                                Before an event is processed, the data passed to the API is analyzed. If any problems are found that cause the event processing not to occur then the problem is reported back to the calling application as 'errors'.  
                                 
                                An example of an 'error' would be an invalid DFN number for a patient.

                                During the processing of an event, certain data passed to the API can be found to be inappropriate or inaccurate but was not crucial to the processing of the event. These types of problems are reported back to the calling
                                application as 'warnings'.  
                                 
                                An example of a 'warning' would be Agent Orange(AO) exposure information passed for an encounter that did not require AO information.
