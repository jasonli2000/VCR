              DESCRIPTION:        This describes the type of schedule for the dispensing of the medication(s) that make up the order.  
                                  PRE-OP orders are usually considered to be ON-CALL orders, and orders dispensed as MUTLI-DOSE CONTAINERS are usually considered to be FILL ON REQUEST orders.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                  This is used to determine how the order will be dispensed by the pharmacy to the ward.  This is used mainly when the Unit Dose package calculates the number of units or doses to be dispensed for a given date/time range.

              DESCRIPTION:        This is the frequency (ONLY) with which the doses are to be administered.  Several forms of entry are acceptable, such as Q6H, 09-12-15, STAT, QOD, and MO-WE-FR@AD (where MO-WE-FR are days of the week, and AD is the
                                admin times).  The schedule will show on the MAR, labels, etc.  No more than TWO spaces (Q3H 4, TID PC PRN, or Q4H PRN) in the schedule are acceptable.  If the letters PRN are found as part of the schedule, no admin times
                                will print on the MAR or labels, and the PICK LIST will always show a count of zero (0).  
                                  Avoid using notation such as W/F (with food) or WM (with meals)in the schedule as it may cause erroneous calculations.  That information should be entered into the SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS.  
                                  When using the MO-WE-FR@AD schedule, please remember that this type of schedule will not work properly without the "@" character and at least one admin time, and that at least the first two letters of each weekday
                                entered is needed.

              DESCRIPTION:        The rate at which the IV is to be administered.  This value, in conjunction with the total volume of the hyperal or the admixture type, is used to determine the time covered by one bag; hence the system can predict the
                                bags needed during a specified time of coverage.  This field is free text for IVPB's.  For LVP's you must enter a number that will represent the infusion rate.  You may also specify the # of bags per day that will be 
                                needed.  
                                 
                                  Example.  125 = 125 ml/hr (IV system will calculate bags needed per day) 
                                          125@2 = 125 ml/hr with 2 labels per day 
                                      TITRATE@1 = TITRATE with 1 label per day.  
                                 The format of this field is either a number only or

                                Note: If an administration time(s) is defined, the number of labels will reflect the administration time(s) for the IVPB type orders.  For example:  One administration time of 12:00 is specified.  The infusion rate is
                                entered as 125@3.  Only 1 label will print.
