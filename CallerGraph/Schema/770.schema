This file contains parameters associated with non-DHCP applications from whom the DHCP system can accept HL7 transmissions.  
 
This is the main file that sites must edit before they can begin receiving HL7 transmissions from another system.  This is done by using the Non-DHCP Application Parameters Enter/Edit option on the site manager's menu.

              DESCRIPTION:      The applications that the DHCP system will communicate with are referred to as non-DHCP applications simply as a way of distinguishing between the two applications.  The application that the DHCP system will be 
                                communicating with could also be another DHCP application (e.g., Radiology sending/receiving HL7 messages to MAS).  
                                 
                                All application names (in files 770 and 771 combined) must be unique.
