The Disability File contains all diagnostic disability codes that may be used to establish a veteran's eligibility for ROES orders. Each code is associated with one or more product groups that are available from the DDC. The diagnostic codes are looked
up in dictionary 31, the Disability Condition File, using the "C" cross reference. All data in this file is distributed with ROES and should not be edited at the local facility.
