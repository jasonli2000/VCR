This file is used to store lab test data sent from the LAB DATA file (#63) until such time as a Women's Health package user can determine if the lab test should be entered as a procedure in the WV PROCEDURE file (#790.1).  If the lab test is converted
into a procedure entry in FILE 790.1, it will be deleted from this file. Also, the Women's Health package user may decide to delete the lab test from this file if it is determined that the lab test is not to be tracked in FILE 790.1.
