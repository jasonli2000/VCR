This file is used to define whether or not your site will be generating interim reports of patient lab values and to what locations these reports will be sent or routed.  Interim reports are defined as hard copy print- outs of a patient's test results
which are generated between the times that the permanent chart copy (cumulative) is printed and made available.  The entries in the fields of this file also let you determine whether or not to generate these interim reports automatically upon
verification of the results in the lab, and specify the device (printer) for any of the reports to print on at a given location.  NOTE:  In order to have ANY location receive automatically generated interims, you must fill in the field 'Queue verified
test(s) notice' in the LABORATORY SITE file (#69.9) with 'YES'.
