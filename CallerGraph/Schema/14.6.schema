Most TaskMan tasks run in the same uci and volume set in which they were created.  However, tasks that need a device that is only available from a different volume set can not.  Such tasks must run on the volume set from which the device is available, in
a uci equivalent to their current one.  Equivalent ucis on different volume sets can have different names, so this file indicates which ucis on different volume sets are equivalent.  
 
TaskMan only directly uses the "AT" and "AV" indices.  The "AT" index has this structure:  ^%ZIS("AT",.01,1.5,2.5,3)="", and is used to find equivalent ucis on different volume sets.  The "AV" index has this structure: ^%ZIS("AV",1.5,.01)="", and is used
to determine whether a certain uci is part of a certain volume set.  
 
Whenever the VOLUME SET field of the VOLUME SET file is changed, a MUMPS cross-reference searches through this file and re-cross-references all pointers to that entry, thereby keeping the two files in synch.
