              DESCRIPTION:      The Nature of Order Activity determines actions that OE/RR will take when it is notified that an order was held or canceled by the imaging service.  The Nature of Order Activity you enter here may trigger or suppress OE/RR 
                                printing of a chart copy of the hold or cancel order.  It may also trigger or suppress OE/RR alerting the original requesting physician that his/her electronic signature is needed.  The master file of Nature of Order
                                Activities resides within the OE/RR software and may be configured different at each facility.  The Radiology/Nuclear Med ADPAC should coordinate Nature of Order Activity set-up with the OE/RR or clinical coordinator.
