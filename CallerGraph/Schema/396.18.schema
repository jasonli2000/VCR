This file maintains a list of definitions used to generate examination templates in the CAPRI GUI interface. These definitions will be used by providers to document C&P examinations in point-n-click format.  The definitions will not be used in the
roll-n-scroll AMIE-II application and are specific to the GUI environment.  Old definitions, as they are retired, will be retained in the file for historical purposes.  This file should remain standardized between all sites and entries not be modified,
removed, or added except through patch installation.

396.18,1      DESCRIPTION            1;0   WORD-PROCESSING #396.181

              DESCRIPTION:
                                The text placed in this field will be displayed in the template selection dialog in the CAPRI GUI to assist the user in making a selection.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  S %DT="E" D ^%DT S X=Y K:Y<1 X
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 01, 2002 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                If a template is loaded but should not become active until a date in the future, that date can be set with this field.  If the date entered has already passed, the template will become active immediately.  


396.18,3      DE-ACTIVATION DATE     2;2 DATE

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  S %DT="E" D ^%DT S X=Y K:Y<1 X
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 01, 2002 
              DESCRIPTION:      Placing a date in this field will de-activate the template on the date specified.  It will often occur that an entry will contain a de-activation date and another entry in the file that's meant to replace it will contain
                                the same date but in its activation date field.   Once a template has de-activated, a user will not be able to create a new document using that template but can still access old documents previously created with the
                                template.
