The MEANS TEST CHANGES file is a file which tracks certain types of actions to a means test.  Such actions which lead to an entry in this file are adding a means test, edits to a means test, changing a means test category, adjudicating a means test.  
 Entries are automatically added to this file as an event to an action on a means test.  
 A deletion of a means test will result in the deletion of any changes previously recorded in this file for the patient and date of means test being deleted.
