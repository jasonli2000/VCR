This file stores report criteria specifications used to print reports defined in the SCHEDULING REPORT DEFINITION (#404.92) file. 
 
These user-defined templates can then be access by the user, eliminating the need to specify the criteria each time a report needs to be executed.  
 
The user can created/edit/copy/delete his or her own templates. The user can also specify whether the template is a 'personal' or 'public' template. Personal templates can only be used by the user who created it. Public templates can be used by anyone
but can only be edited by the template creator. However, another user can copy and edit a public template specification by using the 'Save As...' command.  
 
Templates are only available on client workstation.
