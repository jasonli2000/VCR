454,131       TELEWORK INDICATOR     TW;0 Multiple #454.0131

              DESCRIPTION:      This multiple contains the single character code, definition and telework eligibility for each of the various types of telework agreements that are available to employees.  An employee who has a telework agreement must 
                                have one of the codes defined here as eligible for telework.  The employees telework indicator code is entered and maintained in the Central PAID system and transmitted and stored in VistA in the PAID EMPLOYEE file (#
                                450).  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Subfile of definitions and eligibility of all single character telework codes that have been defined by VACO Payroll Policy and are potentially coded into the AITC PAID database for employees.  Employees with telework 
                                codes in PAID database will have their codes transmitted to the VistA system with either an "Edit and Update" or an "Initial" download.  Employees codes are stored in file 450 and also the current telework code is stored
                                with the employees timecard in file 458 when the pay period is certified.  This provides the ability to recover the employees telework indicator for historical pay periods.
