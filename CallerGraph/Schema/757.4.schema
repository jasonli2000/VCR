This file contains a list of expressions (pointers) from the expression file #757.01 and shortcuts by context.  The expression(s) pointed to will be returned immediately if any of the context sensitive shortcuts associated with that expression are
detected (exact match) in the users input.  The context must be a default value stored in the user defaults in the Subset Definition file #757.2 to permit the use of the shortcuts.

                DESCRIPTION:      Pointer to the Shortcut Context file.  The context of the shortcut set is selectable as a user default.  This enables the same shortcut to represent different expressions based on the context selected by the user.  
                                  During searches of the Lexicon, if the shortcut is found in the user's input (exact match), and the shortcut context is contained in the user's defaults, then the expression pointed to will be returned immediately.
