The Lexicon has the capability to maintain several sets of shortcuts to rapidly access the expression file.  Each of these shortcut sets is named by the context for which the shortcut set was meant to have been used.  The user may select this shortcut
set by it's context name as their default set of shortcuts to use while searching the Lexicon.

              LAST EDITED:      APR 25, 1995 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a flag which indicates if a site should be allowed to edit the shortcuts.  Not all shortcut context should be editable at the site.  For example, it should not be permitted to add shortcuts to the context "Null," 
                                which was designed to be void of shortcuts.  Some shortcut context may be provided by and controlled by applications, and should not be edited at the sites.  However, this is the exception and not the rule.  The majority
                                of the shortcuts will be site editable.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 09, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is MUMPS code in the form of an IF statement without an action to perform, similar Fileman's to DIC("S").  It is used as a screen during look-up in the expression file to return only those expressions which qualifiy
                                in this context.  For example, the context "ICD DIAGNOSIS/PROCEDURES" has a screen which excludes all expressions not linked to an ICD-9 code.
