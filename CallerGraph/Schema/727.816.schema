              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 14 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Feeder key is a fixed length field. The ACTION TO SEND field (#5) of the CLINIC AND STOP CODES file (#728.44) for this clinic determines the construction of this key. It is derived from DSS selected stop codes and credit
                                stop codes (or MAS selected stop codes and credit stop codes in the absence of DSS selected ones), length of appointment, clinic internal entry number in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44), and whether or not this
                                was a no show appointment.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The feeder key is a 14 character code of the form SSSCCCTTTPPPPN; where 
                                   SSS = primary stop code 
                                   CCC = secondary stop code 
                                   TTT = appointment length in minutes

                                One of three transmission styles may be assigned to the clinic in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44).  
                                  
                                For all styles, SSS and CCC are taken from the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44).  The DSS STOP CODE field (#3) and DSS CEDIT STOP CODE field (#4) are used for SSS and CCC respectively.  If field #3 is null, then the
                                STOP CODE field (#1) and CREDIT STOP CODE field (#2) are used.  If field #1 is null, then data is taken from the STOP CODE NUMBER field (#8) and the CREDIT STOP CODE field (#2503) of the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).  If
                                field #8 is null, then both SSS and CCC are set to "000".  
                                   
                                For style 1, CCC is always "000" and PPPP is always "0000".  
                                  
                                Styles 2 and 3, defined in previous versions of DSS Extracts, are no longer valid.  
                                   
                                For style 4,  PPPP is the National Clinic code assigned to this clinic; it is taken from the NATIONAL CLINIC filed (#7) of file #728.44.  The original source if this data is the NATIONAL CLINIC file (#728,441).  
                                   
                                For style 5, PPPP is always "0000".  
                                  
                                In all styles, N is set to "N" if the STATUS field (#3) in the APPOINMENT sub-file (#2.98) of the PATIENT file (#2) is set to "NO-SHOW".  
                                   
                                In all styles SSS, CCC, TTT and PPPP are padded with leading zeroes as needed; the Feeder is always exactly 14 characters.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is initialized to a null, indicating an outpatient status. If a call to IN5^VADPT (using the patient IEN and the event date) returns a patient movement number (indicating inpatient status), then the value of 
                                VAIP(8), which is the pointer to the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY file (#45.7), is used to get the SPECIALTY field (#1) which points to the SPECIALTY file (#42.4).

              DESCRIPTION:      The primary CPT code and modifier(s) followed by secondary CPT code(s) and modifier(s) in a concatenated string.  Only the first CPT code is required.  Each CPT code is exactly 5 characters and each modifier is exactly 2

                                ENCEVENT^PXAPI. The API returns all visit data in the ^TMP("PXKENC",$J) array.  
                                  
                                If a Primary Provider is specified for this patient visit, then the first CPT code associated with that Primary Provider is used as the primary CPT code.  Otherwise, the first CPT code listed in the array is used as the
                                primary CPT code.  The remaining CPT codes are used as secondary CPT codes, upto a total of 7 secondary CPT codes.  
                                  
                                Modifiers are found in the CPT MODIFIERS file (#81.3), but it is not known at this time how modifiers will be stored in the Visit file structure.
