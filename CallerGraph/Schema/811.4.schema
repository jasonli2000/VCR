When none of the standard Clinical Reminder finding types will work, a computed finding can be created. There are two steps in creating a computed finding. First a MUMPS routine must be written. Information about how to do this can be found in the
Clinical Reminders Manager Manual. The second step is to make an entry in this file, which contains a list of reminder computed findings. There are four fields for each entry; they are: 
 
NAME - this is the name of the computed finding. When adding a computed finding as finding to a reminder definition or term, it is done using the name. For example, you would type CF.VA-BMI to add the exported VA-BMI computed finding to your reminder
definition.  
 
ROUTINE - this is the name of the MUMPS routine.  
 
ENTRY - this is the entry point in the MUMPS routine.  
 
PRINT NAME - this will be displayed on the Clinical Maintenance component as the name of the computed finding. If it is blank, then NAME will be used.  
 
TYPE - this is a set of codes that specifies what type of computed finding this is. "S" stands for single occurrence, "M" for multiple occurrence, and "L" for list. If it is blank, single will be assumed.  
 
This file contains a combination of nationally distributed and local entries. Nationally distributed entries have their name prefixed with VA-. Local entry names cannot start with VA-.
