This file holds data from modified image records of the Image file (2005) and serves as an audit trail for modified images.  When image deletion takes place, the image is deleted on the server if it is there, the Parent Report file's pointer to the image
file is deleted, the data from the Image file is copied over to this file using the same IEN, and the node in the image file is set to null as it can never be used again. The image residing on the WORM drive cannot be deleted, so it can always be
retrieved.  
 This file stores the modified image record from the Image file (2005) and serves as an audit trail for modified images.  When image deletion takes place: 
 
  * The image is deleted on the imaging server (if it is there).  
  * The parent report file's pointer to the image file is deleted. 
  * The data from the image file is copied over to this file using the same IEN. 
  * The node is deleted from the image file.  
 The image residing on the WORM drive cannot be deleted, so it can always be retrieved.  The field names and definitions are the same as the Image file (#2005).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the disk name and volume set name where the image will be stored 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field gives the path for the network location of the stored image (i.e. on which server it resides). After a specified time period during which the image is not viewed, the image is deleted from the magnetic server
                                but remains available upon request from the jukebox. It takes slightly longer to display from the jukebox, but if requested, it is moved back to the server until it is no longer being viewed. This field is set 
                                automatically by the Imaging software.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 25, 1993 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field points to the path of the network storage location for the Image abstract.  An abstract is miniature copy of the captured image. If the parent image has not been viewed during the specified time period (if there
                                is a jukebox), this file will be deleted along with the parent image onto the server currently being used to write captured images.  This field is automatically set by the Imaging software.

              LAST EDITED:      SEP 14, 1990 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is a pointer to the Network location file giving the jukebox platter where the image is stored (provided there is a jukebox in the Imaging System).  
                                 If the jukebox is a WORM, this file can never be deleted.

              LAST EDITED:      APR 02, 1994 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is a pointer to the Object Type file (2005.02) which defines the object type of this object, e.g. still image, black & white image, X-ray etc. The image type determines how various actions are performed i.e.  
                                how the full resolution image is displayed, or how and when the image abstract is displayed.  This field is automatically set by the Imaging software at the time of image capture.  


2005.1,4      OBJECT GROUP           1;0 POINTER Multiple #2005.14

              DESCRIPTION:      The object group is a multiple field pointing back to the Image file (2005.1).  Only objects with an object type of GROUP have the object group field defined.  These objects can be thought of as the 'parent' of a set of
                                images.  Generally, instead of having their own abstract, objects of the GROUP type use the abstract of the first entry in their object group multiple.  Sometimes, text will be used in place of the GROUP abstract for 
                                speed.  Methods for viewing a GROUP object generally allow viewing of all the members of the group, either selectively or altogether.  A good example would be a set of thirty CT scan images.  Using the integrated view menu
                                option, the tiled display of image abstracts would contain only one abstract for the group.  Selecting the group object for viewing provides the user with a tiled display of the abstracts of the individual CT scan images. 
                                The user can then identify individual images for full resolution viewing.

                                summarize a group of images which have been put together for a conference or consult.  It will be used in the future to a greater extent, as options for image capture independent of VistA package are provided.

                                site parameter, this field is used for automatic file migration.  That is, when an image has not been accessed within the predefined time period, it will be deleted from the magnetic server and will only be accessible from 
                                the optical disk jukebox.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the date/time of the procedure or the exam. It is obtained from the parent data file, i.e. the date/time of the X-ray exam, the Medical Procedure, the time the Laboratory specimen was obtained from the patient, or
                                the date/time of the Surgical procedure. This often is not the same as the date/time the image was captured. In a long surgical procedure the image capture time may be several hours later than the start of the operation.
                                When a lab specimen is collected from a patient, it may be several days before images are captured from the slide.  If images are initially stored on an intermediate media such as X-ray film or video tape, the capture time
                                can be long after the procedure time.

                                The link to the "parent" information is brought about by the combination of the values of fields 16, 17, and, 18, and optionally also field 63.

              DESCRIPTION:      The values of fields 16, 17, 18 and 63 are numbers.  These numbers are internal entry numbers. Which field corresponds to which internal entry number is explained below.  
                                 
                                Together, the values of these fields establish a link back to the entry in the "parent" file, that holds the information that describes why the image was collected.  
                                 
                                The link to the "parent" information is brought about by the combination of the values of fields 16, 17, and, 18, and optionally also field 63.  
                                 
                                The value of field 16 is a number that indicates the internal entry number of the "parent file" in the VA-FileMan data dictionary.  Common parent files are:

              DESCRIPTION:      The values of fields 16, 17, 18 and 63 are numbers.  These numbers are internal entry numbers. Which field corresponds to which internal entry number is explained below.  
                                 
                                Together, the values of these fields establish a link back to the entry in the "parent" file, that holds the information that describes why the image was collected.  
                                 
                                The link to the "parent" information is brought about by the combination of the values of fields 16, 17, and, 18, and optionally also field 63.  
                                 
                                The value of field 16 is a number that indicates the internal entry number of the "parent file" in the VA-FileMan data dictionary.  Common parent files are:

                                Depending on the nature of the file structure of the parent file, the imaging software will need either just the value of D0 (type 1 and type 2) to find the correct entry, or the values of D0 as well as D1 (type 3).  
                                 
                                The values of the fields in the image file correspond to the values of the indices in the parent file as follows:

                                The list is stored under the "AREF" subscript in the MAG REASON file (#2005.88) and has the following structure: 
                                 
                                 ^MAG(2005.88,"AREF",<Reason>,2005,<IENS>,113.3) = "" 
                                 
                                The <Reason> is the IEN of the reason that is pointed by the STATUS REASON field (113.3).  
                                 
                                Since the IMAGE (#2005) and IMAGE AUDIT (#2005.1) files are closely related and their records cannot have the same IENS, 2005 is used instead of the real number of the file from where the reason is referenced (2005.1).  
                                 
                                The <IENS> is the IENS of the record of the IMAGE AUDIT file (#2005.1) that references the reason.  
                                 
                                The 113.3 is the number of the field that points to the reason (STATUS REASON).
