              DESCRIPTION:      This field should be answered 'Yes' only if selection of this route of administration should trigger a prompt asking for a "free text" site of administration rather than restricting users to selecting a site entered as a
                                valid site of administration for this route.  An example might be a route of administration where there are so many possible sites of administration that it is impractical to associate them all with the route.
