NOTICE: This file is maintained exclusively by the CP Terminology group and must not be modified or edited in any way. Subsequent releases of CP Terminology may create lasting errors in the CliO data store if this file is changed.  
 
This file links like units of measure together with required conversion logic to change the value from one unit to another.  
 
NOTE: Units are presented as entries in the TERM File (#704.101). For example the unit "CENTIMETER" could be identified by the TERM File (#704.101), TERM ID (field #.01) "{EF700458-8C2D-16E8-02DC-9E1711584C53}".
