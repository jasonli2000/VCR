                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a 3-10 character name if this location is to print to an alternate file room. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to designate those locations which a site wishes to print to a "FILE ROOM" location but which they do not wish to be a standard file room. This could be sites which have satellite clinics which have
                                  their own file rooms. The name entered here will cause this location to be sorted to a location called "FILE ROOM_ alternate file room name" followed by a "1" or "2". The patients will be sorted in terminal digit order
                                  similar to the regular file room. This requires that the site has "FILE ROOM" set to "yes" to sort non in-patients to location "FILE ROOM".  
                                   
                                  See description to field #17,"SEPARATE FILE ROOM" for additional information.

                                     two locations, FILE ROOM1 and FILE ROOM2, based on terminal digit of

                                  2. Set field #17, SEPARATE FILE ROOM, to "YES" - this tells the 
                                     cumulative that you are printing the FILE ROOM on a schedule 
                                     different from the regular cumulative schedule.  
                                 
                                  3. For regular FILE ROOM patients, set up one or two reports as follows: 
                                     If one report  - starting location: FILE ROOM1

                                     If two reports - 
                                 
                                       first report - starting location: FILE ROOM1

                                                        ending location: FILE ROOM2 
                                 
                                     Define the other fields as with a regular report.  
                                 
                                  4. If you also want to print certain locations to an alternate file room, 
                                     such as a file room at a satellite clinic then perform the following in 
                                     addition to #3 above.  
                                 
                                     Enter the location(s) that you want to print as a separate report location 
                                     by entering them in the "SEPARATE REPORT LOCATION, field #6.  
                                 
                                     Enter in field #1, "ALTERNATE FILE ROOM" the name to use for this file 
                                     room. This name will be concatenated with "FILE ROOM".  
                                 
                                           e.g. "DALLAS OPC would result in file rooms "FILE ROOM_DALLAS OPC1" 
                                                 and "FILE ROOM_DALLAS OPC2".  
                                 
                                                 Note: The "_", underscore is used to insure that these 
                                                       locations sort after the regular file room locations.  
                                 
                                     Two locations for each file room would be created based on terminal digit 
                                     of SSN or identifier (non-file #2 PATIENT) similar to the regular file 
                                     rooms.  
                                 
                                     Note: These locations will print on the same schedule as regular file 
                                           rooms.  
                                 
                                     Either set up separate reports to print these locations or utilize reports 
                                     defined in step #3 above and alter the ending location to include these 
                                     locations.  
                                 
                                  5. On each report, set the field #3, FILE ROOM REPORT, in the field #2, 
                                     REPORT NAME, multiple to "YES".  
                                 
                                 
                                The cumulative software will check when attempting to print a cumulative for a location that contains the name "FILE ROOM" the following. If field #17 is set to "YES" and the report being run is not set to "YES" for field
                                #3, FILE ROOM REPORT, then it will skip running the cumulative for that location.  This is to prevent another report which may print locations "A" thru "Z" from printing the file rooms unintentionally.
