This file contains the data used in the compilation of the average inpatient bill totals and the monthly unbilled amounts bulletin and report.  
 
The data is in two parts: 
 
     Fields 1.01 - 1.14 contain the inpatient claim and episode totals 
     for the month and prior 12 months used in configuring the average 
     inpatient bill totals.  
 
     Fields 2.01 - 2.11 contain the unbilled inpatient and outpatient 
     totals for the month used in creating the unbilled amounts bulletin 
     and report.  
 
     NOTE: Fields .02 - .16, 19, and 20 will no longer be used for 
           storing and configuring average/unbilled totals and will 
           be phased out at a later date.  
 
This data is generally maintained by two options queued to run once each month. The first option will update the monthly and yearly totals fields. The second option will search the CLAIMS TRACKING file for unbilled episodes of care and should be run on
the 1st or second day of the month.  
 
There are two user options which are available to regenerate the reports. The automatically queued options will not write over previously compiled data. The user queued options will write over previously compliled data. Sites who modify the data in this
file should be aware that the user queued options will overwrite manual changes.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
