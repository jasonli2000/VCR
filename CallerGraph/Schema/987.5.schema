The purpose of this file is to track admissions and discharges of Active duty Veterans and to facilitate the notification of these movements to the DOD. This file is populated by the weekly back ground job [WII BUILD ADT EVENTS].  In order for a patient
to be in this file, the veteran must have one of three eligibilities entered in the Patient File (#2). TRICARE , SHARING AGREEMENT or OTHER FEDERAL AGENCY. 
 
Entries that have a status of approved to transmit will be sent to the VISN for review and then roll up to the DOD.  
 
In the case of admission and discharge occurring in the same collection period there will only be one entry.  In the case that a discharge occurs in a subsequent collection period there will be a second entry.  Entries are dinum to the Patient Movement
file (#405) 
 
Entries into this file should NOT be done manually.  The option WII REVIEW ADT EVENTS WILL utilizes List Manager to allow a point of contact at the local facility to approve entries for transmission or just the opposite block transmission.
