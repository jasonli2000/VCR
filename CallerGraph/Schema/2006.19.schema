                                A site that is not yet configured for Imaging will have an entry in this file created during a production account install, a local image prefix assigned to this entry that screens on this file to maintain uniqueness, that
                                prefix is added to the file locally, and a message is sent to update the master file in the VistA Imaging development account.
