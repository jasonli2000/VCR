              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a "1" to make the exam type inactive. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to inactivate an exam type.  If this field contains a "1" then the exam type is inactive.  Inactive exam types cannot be selected in the manual data entry process. Exam entries should be made inactive
                                when they are no longer used.  Do not delete the entry or change the meaning of the exam entry. 
                                  
                                To make an inactive exam type active, enter the "@" symbol to remove the "1" from the field.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The field was added for use by PCE in the VA.  
                                 
                                The Inactive flag should be used to manage manual access to exams, rather than physically deleting obsolete or inactive entries from the Exam file.  This allows files to still point to the obsolete or inactive exam for
                                historical purposes.
