This file serves as a worksheet for the Request for Quotation process.  The Purchasing agent can edit data imported from one or more 2237s.  This data is then the basis for the electronically submitted RFQ.  Correspondence via 864 Transactions (Text
Messages) are stored in a multiple of this file.  The quotes submitted by vendors are also stored in a multiple of this file.
