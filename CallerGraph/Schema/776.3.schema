              DESCRIPTION:      HL7 System Message Errors are errors discovered by the HL7 system while processing a particular message.  Application Message Errors are errors discovered by an appication while processing a particular message.  This type
                                of error is defined by the application and usually involve application-specific business rules.  Operational Errors are not related to a specific message, rather,they are related to a site.  An common example is a logical
                                link that fails.  An Event Monitor Notification is any sort of status update message that may be posted by the Event Monitors.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field provides a method for application developers to screen which events are sent to a remote server.  At the point at which an event occurs, Event Logging determines what remoted locations to send the event.  If
                                  an application wishes to provide remoted viewing of its events then for those Event Types for which it is concerned it should make an entry in the Server Locations multiple. It can further screen which events to send by
                                  associating a MUMPS screen with that SERVER LOCATION.  When Xecuted, the screen should set $T=1 if the event should be sent to the remote server, 0 otherwise.  The HLEVENT() array is defined at the point at which the
                                  screen is executed.  A complete description of that array is provided for the $$EVENT^HLEME() API that is provide for application developers using the HL7 package.
