Anatomic Pathology images are associated with TIU documents that contain the diagnostic report.  Until the TIU document is created, this Imaging file temporarily records the association for the Anatomic Pathology image entries.  The Lab package notifies
Imaging when an Anatomic Pathology case is electronically signed and a TIU note is created for the report.  Imaging then changes the association parent data file to the TIU document(actually the TIU EXTERNAL DATA LINK file (#8925.91)).  The entry in this
file is then deleted.  
 
If the TUI document exists at the time that the image is acquired, the association is made to it and this file is not used.

              DESCRIPTION:      The image is usually the group-parent of the group of images that is linked to the entity in the temporary file.  
                                 
                                (When the image group consists of one single image, that image won't have a "group parent", and this field will be the image itself.)
