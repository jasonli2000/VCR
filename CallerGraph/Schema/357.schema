This file contains the descriptive information about an encounter form.  An encounter form is composed of many encounter form blocks.  Encounter form blocks contain all the data and lists that appear on the form.  The data from this file along with the
other encounter form files is used to design and print encounter forms.

                                Each form created for scanning should contain at a minimum the following data elements: 
                                  
                                1) Primary provider.  2) At least 1 procedure, usually the Evaluation and Management (EM) code.  3) Reason for visit (diagnosis).  
                                  
                                These steps must be taken during form design for each form type that is to be scanned: 
                                  
                                1) The form field SCANNABLE? should be set to YES.  2) The form field USE ICR? (prompted as 'Should ICR be used to auto- 
                                   matically read hand print on this form?') should be set to YES. It is 
                                   anticipated that the scanning software will include intelligent recog- 
                                   nition software (ICR) for reading hand print in future package releases.  3) A form can be designed with scannable and non-scannable pages. Each page 
                                   to be scanned should have the SCANNABLE? field set to YES. For each page 
                                   selected in the PAGE INFORMATION multiple, the SCANNABLE? field is auto- 
                                   matically set to YES.  4) Selection lists should use bubbles as marking areas. The selection rule 
                                   should be appropriate to the type of data. The selection rule will be 
                                   enforced by the scanning software. For example, if a diagnosis list has 
                                   the selection rule AT LEAST ONE, the form will be flagged as invalid if 
                                   no diagnosis is selected. Also, the proper data qualifier, if one 
                                   applies, should be entered. An example illustrating the use of data 
                                   qualifiers is a selection list for diagnosis codes where there is a sub 
                                   column for selecting the primary diagnosis and another sub column for 
                                   selecting secondary diagnoses. At the bottom of the selection list an 
                                   area can be created to contain 'other' codes not found on the list.  5) All hand print to be scanned must use hand print fields, except for the 
                                   'other' feature of selection lists.  6) The PACKAGE INTERFACE file (357.6) contains the complete list of data 
                                   that is currently scannable.  
                                  
                                There are several forms that are included with AICS v3.0 that are scan- nable. There are also a number of tool kit blocks included that were designed to be scannable. The best approach to creating the forms needed by your
                                facility is to first develop a few basic forms, without clinic specific coding, suited to your site's needs. Those forms can then be placed in your tool kit and used as the basis for developing the rest of your forms.

                                    .Individual pages of the form to be scanned are selected later 
                                     at the PAGE INFORMATION prompt.

                                  For example, if a form has a total of 2 pages, and page #1 is to be scanned and page #2 is not scannable; at the PAGE INFORMATION prompt enter 1.  When this form is printed, a small black box will print at the bottom of
                                  page #1 to indicate that it is a scan- nable page.  
                                    
                                  At the time a form is scanned, the data from each scanned page is stored in the Encounter Form Tracking file (357.96). If the form has multiple scannable pages, and the software has not received all pages for the form,
                                  it will display a message to the user indicating that it is awaiting additional pages.  Once all pages have been scanned in, the data is sent to update the PCE files.
