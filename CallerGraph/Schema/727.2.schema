This file contains the set of laboratory tests tracked by the Decision Support System along with the corresponding local data names in the LABORATORY TEST file (#60) pointed to by these tests.  This file also contains the local names for BLOOD and URINE
specimens.  Each DSS Lab Test is assigned a predefined indicator (SOURCE field) of the type of specimen (blood or urine) that will be used as search criteria in conjunction with the local names for blood and urine specimens.  
 
Entries in this file are determined by the DSS Program Office and should not be changed or deleted.  New entries in this file should not be made.
