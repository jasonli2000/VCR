              DESCRIPTION:      IRM Staff or Clin Coordinator:  Use this field to disable (inactivate) a health summary component (e.g., Lab Orders).  Setting this DISABLE FLAG field to P(ermanent) causes a component to be non-selectable for use, and
                                prevents the component from being printed in any Health Summary in which it is included.  Setting DISABLE FLAG to T(emporary) causes a component to be non-selectable for use, but its OUT OF ORDER MESSAGE will appear in any
                                Health Summary in which it is included.
