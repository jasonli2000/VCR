This file holds the original internal entry numbers (IENs) and the new IENs for payments that have been moved. This is expected to occur when the patient merge process causes data in the FEE BASIS PAYMENT file to move.  The Fee Basis special patient
merge routines (FBPMRG*) automatically populate this file during patient merges.  
 
The server routines that process data from the Austin Automation Center use the information in this file to link data received from Austin with payments that are moved after being reported to Austin.

                                payment (subfile 162.04) with iens "1,2000," would be located at ^FBAAC(2000,3,1,0).

              DESCRIPTION:      The internal entry numbers (iens) that describe the new location of the payment after the patient merge has completed. The iens are delimited by commas (,) beginning with the ien of the lowest level subentry. For example,
                                a travel payment (subfile 162.04) with iens "1,3000," would be located at ^FBAAC(3000,3,1,0).
