              DESCRIPTION:      This is a standard MUMPS pattern that is used to verify that the argument list for the function has the correct format. This is used when verification is done optimally by a single pattern. ARGUMENT PATTERNS (#3) field is
                                used when verification is better done with a separate pattern for each argument.

                                PATTERN (#2) field is used when verification is better done with a single pattern.
