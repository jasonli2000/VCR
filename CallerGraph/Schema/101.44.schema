The newer CPRS ordering dialogs use a Windows Listview control for displaying lists of orderable items and quick orders.  Using this control will help us rely less on custom built controls to handle long lists of items.  While the Listview control is
able to operate on long lists of items, it must know at the outset how many items are potentially going to display and must be able to map from any sequence number produced by the Listview control  to a specific item in the list.  The ORDER QUICK VIEW 
file (101.44) provides this mapping.  It maps a subset of orderable items or quick orders in alphabetical order to specific sequence numbers.
