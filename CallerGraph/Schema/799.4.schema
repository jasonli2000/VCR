The ROR HIV RECORD file stores the patients' data specific to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Registry (CCR:HIV).  
 
Records of this file have the same internal entry numbers as the corresponding records of the ROR REGISTRY RECORD file (#798).  
 
When an CCR:HIV record is deleted from the ROR REGISTRY RECORD file, the corresponding record of this file is deleted automatically.  
 
A permanent screen (the ^DD(799.4,0,"SCR") node) restricts access to this file. Only the users who have the CCR:HIV security key(s) and those with the ROR VA IRM key can access the records of the file.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Internal value of this field is used as the internal entry number of the record (the 'DINUM' feature).  Therefore, the corresponding records of this file and the ROR REGISTRY RECORD file have the same internal entry
                                numbers.
