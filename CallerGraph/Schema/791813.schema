The Remote Order/Entry Parameter File contains a number of fields that give the ADPAC's at each local facility the ability to customize portions of the system for use at their stations. Definitions of each parameter and recommendations for the settings
to be used are included in the Parameters section of the ROES V2.0 Technical Manual.  
 
Data definitions are distributed with the ROES. No data is distributed.

              DESCRIPTION:      If this field is answered 'YES', in the Enter/Edit Patient Orders option the user will be asked if a new address should be entered for a patient.  If a new address is entered, the new address will be transmitted to the DDC
                                for update of the DDC database.  The DHCP patient file at the station will not be changed.  The patient should be sent to MAS to update the station database.  If 'NO' is entered, the address in the DHCP patient file will
                                be used for the order.

                                defining the time of day for queueing transmission batches.  If a 'C' is entered, the user closing a batch will be asked for a date and time to queue the batch.  If an 'A' is entered, the batch will be queued automatically
                                every day at the time set in the parameter 'Standard Queue Time for Batch'.  If no entry is made in this field, immediate queueing will be assumed.
