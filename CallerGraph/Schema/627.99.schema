The DSM Conversion (#627.99) file is used during the process of repointing Medical Record (#90), Generic Progress Notes (#121), and Diagnostic Results - Mental Health (#627.8) DSM data from the DSM3 (#627) or DSM-III-R (#627.5) files to the new DSM
(#627.7) file.  DSM Conversion file holds the DSM patient data in these files prior to conversion, making possible graceful restoration of patient data to baseline in the case of catastrophe.  In addition to the fields contained in  the DSM Conversion
file, additional global nodes are created by the conversion software and stored in the ^YSD(627.99,"AS" global space.  (These nodes are NOT restorable by reindexing the file!)  The "AS" nodes are used to track the progress of conversion and enable the
conversion process to be restarted an unlimited number of times.  The ^YSD(627.99,"AS","TE" global space are used to track conversion data that does not meet the data stored on the "TE" conversion criteria checks.  If errors exist, the "TE" nodes will be
used to create the error report.
