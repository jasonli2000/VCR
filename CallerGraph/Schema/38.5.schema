The INCONSISTENT DATA file contains those patient's who were found to have missing and/or inconsistent data elements in the PATIENT file by the MAS consistency checker.  For each patient the date the inconsistencies were first identified, last
identified, by whom, etc., is stored as well as the individual inconsistencies.  The inconsistent data elements are stored in the INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS file where individual checks can be turned on or off by the facility.  Once the data is corrected
through the appropriate registration menu options, the entry will be removed from this file.
