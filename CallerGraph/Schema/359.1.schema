              DESCRIPTION:      A type of data that is recognized as such within the framework of scanning DHCP forms and which requires its own description for scanning/recognition.  
                                 
                                Enter a type of data that can appear on a scannable encounter form.  The data should require a unique description for each commercial scanning application in use.  For example, check out date/time or CPT procedure require
                                a definition for scanning.

              LAST EDITED:      SEP 28, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Choose the most appropriate data type from the list. 
              DESCRIPTION:      These are the data types provided for by Paper Keyboard.  The ALPHA data type can be further described by a Paper Keyboard picture clause.  The Integer data type does not apply if the field can contain spaces or puntuation
                                other than a '+'.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-60 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter a picture clause specific to Paper Keyboard.  A picture clause describes the intended format for the data type.  This is similar to an M pattern match.  For example, a CPT code is 5 characters, the first character
                                may be an alpha or numeric followed by 4 numeric characters.  To represent this picture in Paper Keyboard, one would enter the picture X####.

              HELP-PROMPT:      You may optionally enter the name of a dictionary to assist in the recognition of ICR fields.  Answer must be 1-12 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Enter the name of a dictionary.  A dictionary can be applied to ICR data types to improve the recognition of ICR fields. This is the name of the file that the scanning software uses.  


359.1,10.04   PK PICTURES FOR SUBFIELDS 10;4 FREE TEXT

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>120!($L(X)<1) X
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 28, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-120 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      When using print formats for paper keyboard you should enter the picture clause in this field.  For example the print format for a SSN might look like ___-__-____ .  This would cause the dashes to be printed and user input
                                to be accepted in three subfields with lengths of 3, 2, and 4 numerics.  You would then enter the picture in this field as ###-##-####.  (note the # sign is used as the picture for numerics)
