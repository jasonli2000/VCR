                                This field should be a short description of the data that will be collected and stored using the barcode program (field #1) that is contained in this file.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is a unique IDENTIFIER of the data that will be stored in this file.  When data is downloaded from a barcode program, the first record received should be the IDENTIFIER of the data being downloaded.  
                                 
                                Once the IDENTIFIER is known, then the data will stored in the BARCODE DATA multiple (446.42,1) for the appropriate entry.  After the data has successfully been uploaded, then the proper LINE TAG (field #.03) and ROUTINE
                                (field #.04) can be tasked to process the data.  
                                 
                                NOTE: The Identifier must be a package namespace followed by two characters.  For example: If the program handles inventory of formulary drugs for outpatient, the identifier might be 'PSOFM'.  The 'PSO' is the outpatient
                                namespace and 'FM' is two characters that further describe the type of program.

                                This cross reference sorts the barcode program by the identifier for lookups.  The node prct(446.4,"c",IDENT,da) is set where IDENT is the identifier.

                                This field can also contain a line tag.  The dash (-) is used, instead of the up-arrow (^) to separate the line tag from the routine.  For example, if the routine that should be called is EN^ENG you would enter EN-ENG in
                                this field.

                                from the barcode reader).

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the time of day that processing of data for this entry should take place.  For example, if 1AM is entered into this field, then any data that needs to be processed for this entry will not take place 
                                until 1AM.  This means that users could be allowed to upload data from a barcode reader during anytime of the day, but allows the local site to use this field to specify what time of the day the data should be processed.  
                                 
                                If this field is blank, then the processing of data will be immediate.  
                                 
                                NOTE: This field contains military time only.  If, for example, 3pm is 
                                      entered, this will be converted to 1500.

                                For example, some programs that process barcode data from this file will require a printer.  If this field is set to 1 (YES), then the user will be prompted for a device.  If this field is set to 0 (NO), then the user will
                                not be prompted for a device and the job will run as a background job with no device associated with it.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is the maximum number of days that the DATE/TIME OF DATA UPLOAD data should exist on the computer system.  
                                 
                                For example: If this field is 20, any data that may have been uploaded over 20 days ago for this entry will be automatically deleted.  Since barcode data is usually 'processed' within a day or two, it is not necessary to
                                keep this information for a long period of time.  It is recommended to keep this data for at least 7 days incase trouble-shooting is necessary.  
                                 
                                If no data is entered for this field, the default is 7 days.

              LAST EDITED:      AUG 14, 1990 
              DESCRIPTION:         This field determines whether or not a bar code program may be downloaded generally (via option PRCT DOWNLOAD BARCODE PROGRAM).  
                                   If a bar code program expects that certain parameters will be passed to it from the host system, this field should be blank. Otherwise it may be set to '1'.  


446.4,1       BARCODE PROGRAM        1;0   WORD-PROCESSING #446.41   (NOWRAP)

              DESCRIPTION:      This word-processing field is used for the storage of the barcode program for the barcode reader.  The program can be downloaded from this field into the barcode reader directly.  
                                 
                                Comments should be included in the barcode program starting with two colons.  During downloading of program from this file to the reader, all comments that use two colons will be striped off and not sent to the barcode
                                reader.  Comments do not need to be resident on the barcode reader itself and it is not recommended since it requires additional memory to store comments.  
                                 
                                It is recommended that comments be included at the end of every line of barcode program for debugging purposes.  Also, utilities exist to aid you with comment alignment.  For example, if a 200 line barcode program has 
                                comments at different columns, it makes read-ability of the barcode program very difficult.  A utility exists to align all comments at a specific (e.g., 30, 35, 40, etc.) column of the barcode program.
