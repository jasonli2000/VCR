and then to merge the entries.

                                This field describes the type of search the Duplicate Resolution software will conduct.  A 'BASIC' search starts at the beginning of a file while the 'NEW' search will only check those newly added entries.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is used to describe the type of search that is currently being run or has been completed.  The Basic search type is used whenever you are starting at the very beginning of a file and searching for duplicates. 
                                The New search type is used to take records from a defined cross reference to check for duplicates in the file.

                                This is the name of the cross reference that should be utilized to separate out any records that you wish to run through the Duplicate Resolution software checking to see if any potential duplicates.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  If the operator chooses to do a 'NEW' search this cross reference will be $Ordered through checking each record against a gathered group of records to determine if any potential duplicates.  
                                 
                                The 'NEW' search will be utilized almost exclusively once the file has gone through a basic cleaning up phase utilizing the 'BASIC' search type.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is utilized by the duplicate software as a starting point whenever the duplicate search is started up from a halted status.  This means that if the search was stopped either by a user or some other reason, the
                                search would start up again starting with this record number.

                                This is the name of the routine which will be used to gather any potential duplicate records which should be checked by the Duplicate Resolution software.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Enter the routine name without the '^' character.  A label entry point reference is allowed but you must use a '-' instead of the normal '^', ex. ENTRY POINT-ROUTINE.  This entry will be executed by the Kernel duplicate
                                resolution software after transforming the '-' into a '^'.

              HELP-PROMPT:      This value is entered when the search process is stopped for any reason. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to track the number of seconds that the search process was running PRIOR TO the most current start (or restart).  The value is determined at the time the process stops for any reason (completed, halt, or
                                error).  While the search is running it does NOT include time for the current process.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the name of the mail group to which you want to send a bulletin when some error causes the halting of the duplicate search or merge process.  The name must be in the Mail Group file. 
              DESCRIPTION:

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 0 and 30, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is the number of days available for ancillary reviewers to conduct their reviews. If action is still pending by any ancillary reviewers after this period, the site may take alternative action;
                                notify designated persons via a mail group, establish an additional reviewer, or otherwise resolve the review. All reviews must be resolved prior to merging the affected record pair. The default with this application
                                release is five days.  Days 1 to 30.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the number of days (0 to 30) which must pass after a patient pair is marked as completely verified as a duplicate pair before the pair may be merged. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the sites determination on the number of days that MUST pass before a completely verified duplicate pair may be merged.  This time period is included to provide for outstanding tests which might have
                                been ordered for the entry which is to be merged into the other one to be completed prior to the merge, so that data are not entered for the merged entry after the merge has been completed.

                                This cross reference is set whenever the Potential Duplicate Threshold is increased.  This Xref is utilized by the Duplicate Resolution software to let it know to go through the existing Non-verified Potential Duplicates 
                                and see if the duplicate record pair meet the increased Potential Duplicate Threshold.  If not, the duplicate record pair entry is deleted from the file.  
                                 
                                The variable XDR("APDTI") is left around if somebody deletes the entry from the Duplicate Resolution file.   This is due to Fileman never allowing you to know if a person is just editing, adding, or deleting an entry.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This optional field is to allow a package developer to send a customized bulletin notifying the Verified Duplicate Mail Group about verified duplicates.  If nothing is entered the Kernel Duplicate Resolution software will
                                send a brief bulletin to the members of the mail group.  This bulletin will only provide the .01 value and the DFN numbers of the two records.  The duplicate resolution software will pass the routine XDRMFR and XDRMTO and 
                                it will be up to this routine to gather any other information it wants to send in the bulletin and also to send the bulletin to the Verified Duplicate Mail Group.  A label entry point is allowed but you must use a '-'
                                instead of the normal '^', ex. ENTRY POINT- ROUTINE.  This entry point will be executed by the duplicate resolution software after transforming the '-' into a '^'.

                                to replace the corresponding fields in the To record.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This optional field is to allow a package developer to send a customized bulletin notifying the Merge Mail Group about merged duplicate pairs.  If nothing is entered, the Kernel duplicate resolution software will send a
                                brief bulletin to the members of the mail group.  The Kernel Bulletin will only provide the .01 values and the DFN's of the two records.  The duplicate resolution software will pass this routine XDRMFR and XDRMTO and it
                                will be up to the routine to gather any information it wants to send in the bulletin and also to send the bulletin to the Merge Mail Group.  A label entry point is allowed but you must use a '-' instead of the normal '^',
                                ex.  ENTRY POINT-ROUTINE.  This entry point will be executed by the duplicate resolution software after transforming the '-' into a '^'.

              DESCRIPTION:      When a PATIENT pair entry is added to the DUPLICATE RECORD file by PSIM, an email is sent to the mail group specified in the DUPLICATE MANAGER MAIL GROUP field, notifying them that the patient pair has been added to the 
                                file with POTENTIAL DUPLICATE, UNVERIFIED status.  
                                 
                                If this field is set to 1 (YES), the email will be suppressed (NOT sent).  If this field is set to 0 (NO), the email will be sent.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is initialized to 1 for the PATIENT file record in patch XT*7.3*113, to suppress sending the email messages while IMDQ processes a potentially large number of duplicate patients generated by the Initiate search
                                engine when its database is initially loaded.  
                                 
                                IMDQ will later use a new option to set the field back to 0, so that email messages will be generated when new entries are added to the DUPLICATE RECORD file.  
                                 
                                If set to null, it will behave as if the field were set to 0.  
                                 
                                The value in this field does not affect the DUPLICATE RECORD MERGE options.
