Bulletins are 'Super' messages.  Each Bulletin has a text and a subject just like a normal message.  But embedded within either the subject or the text can be variable fields that can be filled in with parameters.  There is also a standard set of
recipients in the form of a Mail Group that is associated with the bulletin.  
 
Bulletins are processed by MailMan either because of a special cross reference type of FileMan or because of a direct call in a routine.  The interface for the direct call is described in the documentation on programmer entry points.  FileMan sets up
code that will issue a bulletin automatically when the special cross reference type is created.  In either case the parameters that go into the text and/or the subject make each bulletin unique.
