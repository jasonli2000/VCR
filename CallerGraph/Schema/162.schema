                      TECHNICAL DESCR:  Values stored in the REJECT CODE field are normally expected to have a matching entry in the FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE (#161.99) file.  The FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE file contains a list of reject codes and

                                        However it is possible that a new reject code will be transmitted to VistA by Central Fee and stored in the REJECT CODE field before the FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE file is updated with that new code.  In this
                                        case outputs that display the description of a code will display text similar to "Reject reason code not currently defined in list."

                                          mandatory for each payment entry, but a CPT Modifier is not, to assure a complete cross-reference, the re-indexing should be done on the Service Provided field.

                  DESCRIPTION:    The REJECT CODE field is populated by the FBAA BATCH SERVER and FBAA REJECT SERVER server options when a line item is rejected via the interface with Central Fee.  The REJECT CODE field is not used for local rejects.

                  TECHNICAL DESCR:Values stored in the REJECT CODE field are normally expected to have a matching entry in the FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE (#161.99) file.  The FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE file contains a list of reject codes and their
                                  descriptions.  
                                   
                                  However it is possible that a new reject code will be transmitted to VistA by Central Fee and stored in the REJECT CODE field before the FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE file is updated with that new code.  In this case 
                                  outputs that display the description of a code will display text similar to "Reject reason code not currently defined in list."
