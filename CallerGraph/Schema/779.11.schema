The Health Leven Seven (Optimized) software (HLO) was released as patch HL*1.6*126 to the HL7 v1.6 software package.  Although it is structurally and functionally an independent system, it is officially part of HL7 1.6.  This is a messaging system
similar to the old HL7 1.6 package, but it was designed from the ground up and is more robust, more capable, and supports a much higher message throughput.  
 
This file is used create screens for reporting HLO messaging errors. A screen is a list of criteria used to either include or exclude specific error types in an error report.  
 
A screen is identified by its name.  The name should be namespaced and be descriptive as to its intended use.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is a list of strings used to determine what errors should display.  Each string is compared to each error that would otherwise be included in the display.  If the string matches a string that occurs within the error,
                                the error is either: 
                                 
                                INCLUDE type screens - the error will be included in the display.  EXCLUDE type screens - the error will be excluded from the display.  
                                 
                                This is the verbatim text of the error to be screened. A list of possible errors is in the HLO Technical Manual. Alternately, you may cut and paste text from the error display into this field. You might screen errors for
                                the following purposes: 1)  To exclude certain errors from the display.  Some of the errors don't require any action on your part.  2)  To display only certain errors.   These are critical errors which you want to act on
                                quickly.  You KNOW from experience what those errors are.
