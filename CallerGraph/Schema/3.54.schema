This file is for internal use by TaskMan and the Device Handler in the sequential processing of tasks.  Jobs that have been sent to a resource-type device will be monitored according to fields in this file.  To accomodate the Device Handler's need to
write to but rarely read from this file, the translated ^%ZISL global is used.  This file is cross-referenced by name and job number.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates whether another task can be sent to this resource.  For sequential or single thread processing, this field will have a constant value of one.  The RESOURCE SLOTS field in the Device file is used to
                                determine the number.  If the RESOURCE SLOTS are greater than one, the value of this field will change as the beginning tasks complete and slots become available for other tasks that have been directed to this resource.
