This file is used to restrict entries into 'person' type fields in other files.  Each entry will contain a field name, file number, field number, and (site determined) keys to restrict entries.  Fields in other files that will be restricted will call the
routine SROXPR as part of the input transform.  This will determine whether there are any restrictions and if so, whether the person selected has the proper keys to be entered into this field.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the field identifier.  It is the combination of a file (or sub-file) number and field number.  These numbers are separated by a comma.  Examples of typical entries are listed below.  
                                 
                                  1. 130,.14   <-------- 130 is the file number of the SURGERY file 
                                                         and .14 is the field number of the SURGEON 
                                                         field contained in that file.  
                                 
                                  2. 130.28,.01 <------- 130.28 is the sub-file number of the OR 
                                                         CIRC SUPPORT sub-file of the SURGERY file.  
                                                         .01 is the OR CIRC SUPPORT field within the

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This is the field identifier.  It is a combination of file (or sub-file) number and field number.  These numbers are separated by a comma.  For example, the SURGEON field in the SURGERY file would have '130,.14' as it's
                                field identifier.  Entries in this file are created by the SROKEY option.

                TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                  This will be used to restrict entries into this field.  The routine SROXPR will be called by the input transform on restricted fields in other files.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter '1' if keys can be added for this field at each medical center. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This determines whether the keys associated with this field can be modified at each individual medical center.  If this field is set to '0', only the keys created by the initialization of the package will be used to
                                restrict entries.  The deletion or addition of keys will not be allowed.
