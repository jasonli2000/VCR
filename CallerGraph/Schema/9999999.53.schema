DATA DICTIONARY: 
 This is a standard RPMS data dictionary, maintained in the AUT package.  Changes to this data dictionary must be submitted to the RPMS DBA.  
 
ENTRIES IN THIS FILE: 
 ADMISSION SOURCE contains data on the subject from the UB92 definitions.  Adds/edits to the data will be distributed through the RPMS DBA, using standard AUM updates.  
 
HISTORY: 
 This file was created in June, 1999, at the request of ANMC, in need of using admission sources from the UB92.  This information was previously in field 6102 of V HOSPITALIZATION, as type SET, but was unable to accommodate all the admission sources as a
SET.  Field 6102 in V HOSPITALIZATION was never used, so no data conversion was created.  
 
February, 2000 - Distributed in AUT*98.1*5, in support of the needs of AUPN and APCD.  14 entries were included.  


IDENTIFIED BY: UB92 CODE (#.02)[R]
