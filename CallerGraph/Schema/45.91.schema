This file contains the RUG-II groupings used for reimbursment for patients that reside on long term care units (those with services of either intermediate or nursing home care).  Each time a patient is transferred or admitted to a ward of one of these
types, a patient assessment instrument must be completed (these are stored in the PAF file - #45.9).  Additionally, twice a year, a census of nursing home and intermediate medicine wards is taken and assessments are done at that time.  Once an assessment
is completed, a patient is placed into one of the 17 RUG-II groups based on the level of care s/he is receiving.  The 17 RUG groups are stored in this file along with the yearly WWUs (weighted work units) for each.  These weighted work units are supplied
by MAS VACO and the Boston DPC (which supports the RUG-II program) and are used for reimbursement at the medical center level.
