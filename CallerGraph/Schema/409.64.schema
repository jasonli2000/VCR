 This table contains the query object definition for a specific database 
 file supported by a custodial package. This definition specifies any specific 
 mehtods and properties that are needed beyond the generic methods and 
 properties available.  
 
 Using this query object interface, custodial packages can allow access 
 to internal data entries to other packages without direct global access 
 and integration agreements.

              DESCRIPTION:       This property contains query object specific logic that the custodial 
                                 package must specify that allows the use of the Scan method by 
                                 developers.  
                                 
                                 This scan logic typically hard codes references to supported indexes.  
                                 There is a significant performance reasons for the custidial packages 
                                 to develop this logic. The Next/Eof scanning approach is much slower then 
                                 using Scan/Scan Callback approach.

                                 fields on the zero node.  
                                 
                                 Various methods of the query object need to make available to 
                                 developers the zero node of an entry. For example, during the execution 
                                 of the filters and scan callbacks, the zero node is made available 
                                 to developers in the variable Y0.

                                 node, then logic similar to the following needs to be specified 
                                 in this property:

                DESCRIPTION:       This property contains any query specific validator logic that the 
                                   custodial pacakge needs performed. This logic is executed 
                                   after the various methods execute the intrinic $QUERY function.  
                                   Normally, the generic validator associated with the index type is 
                                   sufficient and no custom logic is required.  
                                   
                                   The validator checks to see if $QUERY returns a value that is 
                                   beyond the scope of the query object's properties. For example, 
                                   if your query is for a specific patient, the validator will 
                                   check if a new patient has been reached by $QUERY.
