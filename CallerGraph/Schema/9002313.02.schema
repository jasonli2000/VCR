Intermediate form of claims.  Fields are stored in formatted form.  Raw packet is also stored.  
 
Most fields are in Free Text format to accommodate NCPDP Standard formatting criteria and required field lengths.  Fields other than those with decimals in the number correlate directly to the field numbers supplied in the NCPDP Data Dictionary.  
 
While many of the fields in this file indicate coded values, they are NCPDP coded values proceeded with the NCPDP field identifier to be used in the NCPDP transmission.  Example:  Compound Code is either a 1 or 0.  The NCPDP field identifier for
'Compound Code' is 'D6'.  The field length is 3 thereby allowing the identifier for that field to be included in the data stored in that field.  Such as 'D61' for the data stored.  
 
Per VHA Directive 2004-038, this file definition should not be modified.
