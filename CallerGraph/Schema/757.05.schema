                                This field contains words which are meant to be replaced (either physically or logically) prior to calling the look-up utility.  This is a single word (no spaces, hypens or slashes).

                                but has been extended to 40 characters (Word field .01 length) to speed word parsing, indexing and lookup routines.

              DESCRIPTION:

                                ^LEX(757.05,"C",REP,IEN) - where REP is the uppercase form of the Replacement Term (1) to use during word replacements/substitutions and IEN is the Internal Entry Number in the Replacement Words file #757.05 where the
                                Replacement Term is located.  This index is used extensively in the input transformations for both the Excluded Word file #757.04 and the Replacement Term file #757.05 (i.e., you can not replace word with a word which is
                                to be excluded from lookup and you can not exclude a word from lookup which is to be replaced).

              DESCRIPTION:
                                Action indicates whether a WORD is physically (R)eplaced by the REPLACEMENT TERM in the user's input, or (L)ogically replaced by linking the WORD to each occurrence of the REPLACEMENT TERM which carries the same meaning.

                                ^LEX(757.05,"ALINK",WORD,EXP) - where WORD is the Internal Entry Number of the location of the WORD (.01) in the Replacement Word file #757.05 to link to an expression and EXP is the Internal Entry Number of the expression
                                in the Expresion file #757.01 which the Word is linked to.  Additionally, the index node ^LEX(757.01,"AWRD",WORD,EXP,"LINKED") is set where WORD is the Word (.01) in the Replacement Word file #757.05 to be linked to an
                                expression and EXP is the Internal Entry Number in the Expression file #757.01 where the expression is located.  This creates a keyword linkage between the word and the expression.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is a series of pointers to expressions to which the WORD (.01) is linked to.  When a word like "CANCER" is linked to an expression like "CARCINOMA OF THE LUNG", the pointer of the expression is listed here and a
                                separate index node is created in the expression file (757.01) at ^LEX(757.01,"AWRD","CANCER",DA,"LINKED")=""  Subsequent searches for "LUNG CANCER" will be able to retrieve "CARCINOMA OF THE LUNG."  During input, editing
                                of this multiple field will only occur if ACTION (2) is set to "L" (linked words).
