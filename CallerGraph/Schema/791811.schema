This file contains all the products. that may be ordered from the Denver Distribution Center through the Remote Order/Entry System.  The file contains information about each item that is needed in the order process. Components, batteries, etc. that may
be used with each item are also stored in the file. This file is exported by the DDC. The file will be updated via patch as contracts are updated. Since the unit cost of some items varies with discounts that occur on individual purchase orders for that
item, the cost field in this file may not exactly match the cost from the DDC at the time the order is filled, but should give the user a close approximation of the cost. The file should not be edited by the local facility
