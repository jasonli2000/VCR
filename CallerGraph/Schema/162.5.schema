                DESCRIPTION:      The REJECT CODE field is populated by the FBAA BATCH SERVER and FBAA REJECT SERVER server options when a line item is rejected via the interface with Central Fee.  The REJECT CODE field is not used for local rejects. 
                                  The reason for a local reject is entered into the REJECT REASON (#14) field.  

                TECHNICAL DESCR:  Values stored in the REJECT CODE field are normally expected to have a matching entry in the FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE (#161.99) file.  The FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE file contains a list of reject codes and their
                                  descriptions.  
                                   
                                  However it is possible that a new reject code will be transmitted to VistA by Central Fee and stored in the REJECT CODE field before the FEE BASIS PAYMENT REJECT CODE file is updated with that new code.  In this case
