This file is used by the Radiology Imaging Workstation system to define logic for determining a patient's prior exams that may be of interest when viewing a given exam.  Each entry in the file defines a one-to-many relationship for a current exam to
prior exams of interest; the mappings are defined in terms of CPT codes.

              DESCRIPTION:      The CPT "GROUP" corresponds to the Current Case's CPT code, by which logic is defined for finding other exams (by their CPT codes) that may be of interest when viewing an exam that is part of the defined CPT GROUP.  The 
                                CPT GROUP is either: A 5-digit CPT code; the first 4 digits; or, the first 3 digits of the CPT code.  For example, possible CPT GROUP values for the CPT code 71020 are: 71020; 7102; and 710.  CPT GROUP thus allows rules to 
                                be defined for specific CPT codes, or whole groups of codes that share the same leading 3 or 4 digits.  The rationale for this is that the CPT coding scheme GENERALLY (not always) groups code ranges by body parts--we can 
                                take advantage of this to greatly reduce the numbers of entries that would be required to define mappings of exams by their CPT codes.

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 11, 1997 
              DESCRIPTION:      The CPT GROUP concept, explained above in the CURRENT CASE CPT GROUP field, applies here.  These are the codes which, if associated with Prior Cases for a patient, will cause the system to retrieve the images and/or 
                                information automatically for the intended purposes (e.g., Pre-Fetch or Auto-Display).

                HELP-PROMPT:      If you want the defined CPT codes combination to result in Automatically displaying prior exams, enter "YES"; otherwise, enter "NO". 
                DESCRIPTION:      If prior cases having this CPT GROUP should be automatically displayed when reading a Current Case, then the answer should be 'YES'; if not, the answer should be 'NO'.  By allowing this YES/NO for each entry defined, it 
                                  becomes possible to define rules flexibly, using combinations of Inclusive and Exclusive logic.  For example, a possible definition for the CURRENT CASE CPT GROUP for 735: 
                                       CURRENT      PRIOR      AUTO-DISPLAY? 
                                         735         735           Y 
                                                     7356          N 
                                                     7358          N 
                                                     7359          N This example says, for a Current Case with CPT code beginning with 735, do the Auto-Display for any Prior Case having a CPT of 735nn, except for those having CPTs of 7356n, 7358n, and
                                  7359n.  A more complete definition of this example would then (likely) define three CURRENT entries for these latter 4-digit groups.

                DESCRIPTION:
                                  If prior cases having this CPT GROUP should be automatically Pre-fetched from archive storage (i.e. Jukebox) to magnetic disk, then the answer should be 'YES'; if not, the answer should be 'NO'.
