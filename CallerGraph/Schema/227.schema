This file contains canned comments that are entered by DRM Plus administrators and users. These canned comments will be used within the DRM Plus application when completing a note within the new exam elements. A user is only allowed to have 12 total
comments, a restriction set by the GUI, for each category. There are two types of canned comments: system and user. A system canned comment has priority over any user comments.
