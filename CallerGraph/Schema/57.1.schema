              DESCRIPTION:        This is the frequency (ONLY) with which the doses are to be administered.  Several forms of entry are acceptable, such as Q6H, 09-12-15, STAT, QOD, and MO-WE-FR@AD, where MO-WE-FR are days of the weeks, and AD is the
                                admin.  times. The schedule will show on the MAR, labels, etc. No more than ONE space (Q3H 4 or Q8H PRN) in the schedule is acceptable. If the letters PRN are found as part of the schedule, no admin. times will print on
                                the MAR or labels, and the PICK LIST will always show a count of zero (0).  
                                 
                                  Avoid using notation such as W/F (with food) or WM (with meals) in the schedule as it may cause erroneous calculations. That information should be entered in the SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS field. When using the MO-WE-FR@AD 
                                schedule, please remember that this type of schedule will no work properly without the "@" character and at least one admin. time, and that at least the first two letters of each weekday entered is needed.
