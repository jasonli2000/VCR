 A data field can be composed of a label, determined at the time the form description is created, and data, coming from the DHCP database and determined at the time the form prints. The label and data are printed to the encounter form. A data field can
be composed of subfields, each subfield containing possibly its own label and data.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The internal representation starts at 0, the external representation starts at 1. The difference is because for computing the form image it is convenient to work with displacements from the top left-hand corner. However,
                                users do not want to work with row=0 or column=0.
