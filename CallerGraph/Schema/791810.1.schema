This file contains information about order types used in the Remote Order/Entry System. It consistst of a list of all available order types. Associated with each type of order is the type abbreviation, which is used internally in system routines to
determine branching for type specific displays and input sequencing. Each type is also designated as a Patient Type of order or a Station Type of order. All data in this file is distributed with the ROES and should not be edited at the local facility.
