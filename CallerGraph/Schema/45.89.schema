                                The "ASPL" cross reference is used in PTF routines DGPTSC01 and DGPTSCAN to find ICD codes that require additional questions to be asked for the PTF record.  The additional data is stored in the 300 node of the 701 and 501
                                movements.  The specific fields to be asked are retrieved from file 45.88.
