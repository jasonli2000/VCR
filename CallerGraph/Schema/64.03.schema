This file is populated by laboratory software based on DSS's criteria of laboratory products. The filter logic is coded in the routine LRCAPV3. This routine controls/filter which workload codes should be placed into this file.  
 
Laboratory Site file has a field which stop or starts the collection of workload data for DSS purposes. Field COLLECT WKLD LOG FILE DATA (#616) of the LABORTORY SITE FILE (#69.9) should be edited as required.  
 
This file has been converted to be used exclusively by DSS software to collect laboratory workload for DSS defined products. DSS software is responsible for removing the entries from this file based on their time table and file size.
