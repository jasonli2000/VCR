This file is used to store static routing lists for messages.  
 
Static routing lists are lists of recipients that an application may create in advance for its messages.  The alternate routing method is dynamic routing, whereby the recipient list is created by the application at the time the message is created.

              DESCRIPTION:      There are two means of assigning a name to a subscription list: 
                                 
                                1) Subscription lists may be created at design time when developing a new 
                                   messaging application via the user option.  I that case the is textual and 
                                   should be a unique identifier namespaced by the application.  
                                 
                                2) New subscription lists may be created dynamically via an API.  For example, 
                                   a subscription list may be added for a new patient for an existing 
                                   messaging applcation.  In that case the name is numeric, equal to the 
                                   IEN of the entry.
