              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES when the Release of Information has been submitted to MHV. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The MyHealtheVet (MHV) application allows veterans to create an online account.  Once created, the veteran can choose to share the information in their personal health record with all their health care providers, inside
                                and outside the VA.  
                                  
                                A registered MHV user completes a remote proofing process with MHV and when that process is finalized, an update message is sent to the Master Veteran Index (MVI) to set the ROI SIGNED INDICATOR field to YES.  MVI, in
                                turn, updates this same field on VistA.  This allows the MHV system to be viewed via CPRS Remote Data Views and/or VistAWeb, providing the ability to view the electronic medical record using the on-line MyHealtheVet web
                                portal.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the SOURCE ID TYPE value for this entry. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The SOURCE ID TYPE field defines the data source for this entry.  The source ID type is a reference to the HL7 Table 0203, Identifier Type, and the VA Identity Management user defined values: NI (National Identifier), PI
                                (Patient Identifier), PN (Person Number), EI (Employee Identifier), SS (Social Security Number), and NPI (National Provider Identifier).

              HELP-PROMPT:      ASSIGNING AUTHORITY must be 1-70 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      ASSIGNING AUTHORITY stores a portion of the data used to assemble fully qualified identifiers used for either the HL7 v2.4 or v3.0 standard.  It is based on the Health Level Seven (HL7) standardized table 0363 and contains
                                the universal ID subcomponent of the assigning authority component in the standard PID-3 identifier.  
                                  
                                The fully qualified HL7 identifier is composed of the PATIENT (#.01), INSTITUTION (#.02), SOURCE ID (#11), ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#10), and SOURCE ID TYPE (#.09), which constitute a unique entry.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-150 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      SOURCE ID is the unique system assigned identifier at the identified facility for the patient record.  The value of SOURCE ID varies, depending on the source facility.  
                                  
                                If SOURCE ID is from the Master Patient Index, the value is the Integration Control Number (ICN).  If SOURCE ID is from the Department of Defense (DoD), the value is the Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier
                                (EDIPI), which is their equivalent of an ICN.  In the future, SOURCE ID may come from other sources due to additional initiatives.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the status for this SourceID. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The IDENTIFIER STATUS field supports joint VA/DoD medical centers, Veteran's Record Management (VRM), and Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) initiatives.  This field allows the capture of the resolved duplicate
                                events and exposes the related identifier and identifier status to the consuming applications.  
                                     
                                A value of "A" indicates that the patient record is an active record on the identifying system (e.g., VAMC or DoD).  A value of "H" indicates that the patient record was identified as part of a duplicate pair, has been
                                merged, and is no longer active on the identifying system (e.g., VAMC or DoD).
