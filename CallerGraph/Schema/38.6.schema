The INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS file contains those entries which are checked by the MAS module consistency checker.  Other than turning individual checks on or off the user should not alter or add to this file in any way.  Making any modification to this
file will definitely cause the consistency checker to function improperly.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the internal entry number of the inconsistency.  This number is used by the consistency checker routines to determine what action needs to be taken.  Entries in this file must not be added nor altered
                                in any way as this would cause the consistency checker functionality to act incorrectly.

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 12, 1987 
              DESCRIPTION:      Various entries in the PATIENT file become uneditable by certain hospital personnel once the data has been verified.  If the data has been verified, the user must hold a key in order to make a change to it.  If the 
                                inconsistency in this file requires a user to hold a key to edit the data once it has been verified, that key must be listed here.  
                                 
                                Altering of data in this field could cause data to be edited inappropriately.  This field should not be changed!

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 20, 1987 
              DESCRIPTION:      If the data required to clean-up this inconsistency requires editing of data that is related to eligibility, this field should be answered yes.  For example, if the inconsistency is 'SC PROMPT UNANSWERED', this field would
                                be yes because this prompt is required in order to select a patient's eligibility.  If this field is answered yes, all eligibility related questions will also be asked.  
                                 
                                Data in this field must not be altered in any way or it could cause inaccrarate patient data to be entered on your system.  This data is distributed and maintained by the MAS package.

                                Most checks provide the ability for them to be turned off locally, however, there are some consistency checks ('SC PROMPT UNANSWERED', for example) which will always be turned on regardless of how this promt is answered.  
                                 
                                This field can be edited at the site level.

                                STATUS UNANSWERED'.
