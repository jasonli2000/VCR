Lab search criteria are stored in this file. These criteria are referenced by the selection rules and used in the search for Lab results.  
 
It is possible but not recommended to use the same criterion for several different registries.  
 
Records of the file are uniquely identified by the criterion name. The "A" primary key and the "B" uniqueness index are used for this purpose.

                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field indicates the comparison operation applied to the Lab result. The Lab result is compared to the value of the INDICATED VALUE field. 
                                   
                                  NOTE: All string comparisons are case-insensitive.  
                                   
                                  For example, if the internal value of this field is equal to 3 ("Greater Than") and the value of the INDICATED VALUE field is 5, then this indicator will be evaluated as True for all numeric Lab results values greater
                                  than 5.  
                                   
                                  The "Contains" indicator checks if the indicated value is contained in the Lab result value.  
                                   
                                  The only exceptions are the "Use Reference Range" indicator, which checks if the result value is outside of the reference range defined for the Lab test, and the "Positive Result".  
                                   
                                  The "Positive Result" indicator selects a test result if the value 
                                   
                                    * is equal to "P"

                                    * contains "POS", "DETEC" or "REA" and

                                  For example, the "POSITIVE", "POS", "REACT", and "DETECTABLE" values will be picked up. At the same time, the "NON-REACT", "INDETERMINATE", and "NEG" values will be skipped.
