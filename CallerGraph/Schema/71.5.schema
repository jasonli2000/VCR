This file contains valid imaging stop codes.  It is not pointed to by any other file.  The Rad/Nuc Med ADPAC should make sure this file is updated.  Obsolete or unused entries should be deleted.  This file should contain all stop codes that can be
assigned to imaging locations at the facility.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a stop code that is currently valid for Imaging procedures. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Only stop codes valid for imaging should be entered in this file.  When a stop code becomes invalid, it should be deleted from this file.  When a new stop code becomes valid for imaging procedures, it should be added to
                                this file.  Entries are used as a selection list when editing the DSS ID of an imaging location.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The entries in this file are used as a screen for selecting stop codes to associate with Radiology/Nuclear Medicine procedures.  The principal clinic field of the Imaging Locations file is also screened using the entries
                                in this file to make sure the principal clinic chosen has an imaging stop code.  Keeping these codes in a separate file makes them maintainable by the sites.

              EXPLANATION:      Inactive Stop Codes are invalid.  Stop Code 900 cannot be used.
