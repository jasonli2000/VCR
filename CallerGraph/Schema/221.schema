              HELP-PROMPT:      Select 'S' for screening or 'C' for complete exam 
              DESCRIPTION:       SCREENING EXAMINATION The screening examination includes an evaluation of the oral and perioral soft tissues and a visual estimate of dental status without a tooth by tooth charting.  Radiographs usually will not be
                                taken, but may be if PROFESSIONALLY DETERMINED to be necessary as for an emergency.  A chart review (patient not present at time of review) is also classed as a screening exam.  When a chart review is entered the provider
                                must also mark ADMIN PROCEDURE on the screen to avoid a "patient visit" count.  Note:  Providers must be aware of significant medical problems; therefore, a medical and dental history and/or medical record review must be
                                included.  Recall examinations (may be less than six months) would be included in this area.  The screening examination is an essential part of the admission physical examination.  All INPATIENT screening examinations will
                                be placed in a Priority 1 Category.  If the inpatient does not fall into Emergency, Extended Care, NHCU, Dom, or Special Provisions, s/he would be placed in the Compelling Medical Need Category.  All OUTPATIENT screening 
                                examinations will be placed in Priority 1.  
                                 
                                COMPLETE EXAMINATION A complete examination includes dental charting on a tooth by tooth basis as well as the comprehensive evaluation of the oral and perioral soft tissues. A head and neck exam is included as an essential
                                portion of the complete examination.  A thorough review of the medical chart and medical history with the pertinent medical findings noted on the dental record are included in the complete examination.  A complete
                                examination will be accomplished for a patient who is to receive treatment other than emergency care. Complete examinations will be recorded in the appropriate inpatient or outpatient category/priority.

                                be placed in a Priority 1 category.  If the inpatient does not fall into Emergency, Extended Care, NHCU, Dom, or Special Provisions, s/he would be placed in the Compelling Medical Need Category.  All OUTPATIENT

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a '1' or an 'E' for an evaluation 
              DESCRIPTION:      No more than one evaluation per provider can be counted on the same visit.  Evaluations are identified as medical/dental workups, (e.g., periodontal, surgical, endodontic, etc.) on those patients for whom a complete
                                screening examination has already been performed. Evaluations may be in conjunction with review of a medical record, the initiation of an interdisciplinary consultion or with a medical or dental emergency workup on a
                                patient for whom no definitive treatment is delivered. An evaluation made by the staff mentor for trainees at a scheduled treatment visit prior to carrying out a specific treatment procedure is counted as education time.  
                                All other INPATIENT evaluations will be placed in a Priority 1 Category.  If the inpatient does not fall into Emergency, Extended Care, NHCU, Dom, or Special Provisions, s/he would be placed in the Compelling Medical Need 
                                Category.  All OUTPATIENT evaluations will be placed in a Priority 1 Category.

              DESCRIPTION:      COMPLETIONS 
                                 
                                A case is completed when all treatment authorized has been accomplished.  Only one count should be taken for a patient during any single period of hospitalization unless the patient is under long term care.  In the case of
                                long term care patients, including NHC and Dom patients, a count for a completed case may be taken once in each six months if re-examination indicated need for another episode of care.  For outpatients, only one complete
                                case count may be taken per episode of care for which a treatment plan was established, even if there were intervening terminations.  If, after an outpatient case has been completed and s/he is eligible for recall, another
                                episode of care may begin with the recall examination if treatment is indicated.  Treatment plans will not be segmented for the purpose of multiple completions during an episode of care.  For cases administratively
                                completed, also make an entry in the ADMIN PROCEDURE field.

                                A case is terminated when an episode of care is interrupted or stopped short of completion of the authorized treatment plan.  Examples of this would be the death of a patient, discharge to OPT status, closure of the case
                                due to failed appointments, health reasons, or at the patient's request. For cases administratively terminated, also make an entry in the ADMIN  PROCEDURE field.
