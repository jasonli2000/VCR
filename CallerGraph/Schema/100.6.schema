              HELP-PROMPT:      If discharge from an observation specialty should be an exception to this rule, enter YES or IF READMITTING. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This indicates if an observation treating specialty should prevent this rule from being applied, when the patient is discharged from it.  Enter YES if an observation specialty should always be considered an exception to
                                this rule, or NO to never consider it.  IF READMITTED will cause the clerk to be asked if the patient will be immediately admitted again, and a response of YES will prevent this rule from being applied; because it requires
                                user interaction, this value should only be used with the non- tasked OR GUA EVENT PROCESSOR NOTASK protocol on DGPM MOVEMENT EVENTS, otherwise a value of NO will be assumed and this rule will be applied without exception.

                DESCRIPTION:      Movement Type(s) more completely define the trigger event for this rule, to allow for different rules on various types of MAS events.  For example, to define a rule for cancelling orders when a patient dies enter the
                                  movement types DEATH and DEATH WITH AUTOPSY; a movement type may only be used in one active rule, so omit these types when creating other Discharge rules.
