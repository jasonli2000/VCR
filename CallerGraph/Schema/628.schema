              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the name of the Decision System being developed, 3 to 50 characters. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the name of the Decision System algorithm being developed/run.  Each individual decision system has a name, and this name is used to identify what decision system to run, when the user has the choice to choose
                                among decision systems, or it is the name passed to the routines that run a particular decision system for the routines to run automatically when a user signs onto the system.

              HELP-PROMPT:      This is the description of the Decision System being developed (1 to 150 characters in length). 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a description of the Decision Expert system being developed/ run.  The programmer can enter a short description of the decision system and what it relates to in this field.  For example, if it is a decision system
                                pertaining to the diagnosis of gastrointestinal problems, this fact can be entered here; if it is an algorithm about oil exploration, this fact can be described here.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the name of the algorithms in the Decision System.  Each major Decision System identified by the Decision System Name can have Sub- algorithms within it that can be run.  For example, Medicine (Decision System Name
                                - .01 field) can have a Cardiology subalgorithm, a endocrinology subalgorithm, etc.  This field identifies the subalgorithms to the YSEXPERT system so that they can be run, when appropriate.

                HELP-PROMPT:      This is the name of an Algorithm in the Decision System. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This is the sub-algorithm being developed/run under the main Decision System algorithm.  Each Decision System can have subalgorithms and decision support systems grouped under it.  This is the name of the subalgorithm. 
                                  This name identifies the algorithm to the YSEXPERT routines so that they can be run, when appropriate.

                  DESCRIPTION:      This field ties the frames of the algorithm together.  It holds the information about which frame to branch to next, and this is determined by the answer/response given to the 'Prompted Responses' query.  The links are
                                    established by specific rules.  See the package documentation about how to establish links.

                  HELP-PROMPT:      This field will contain EXECUTABLE MUMPS Code that you want executed for the Frame (Node). 
                  DESCRIPTION:      This field can contain MUMPS code that can be executed for the frame, for example, to calculate an antibiotic serum value for a patient on IV antibiotics, given that he has had a serum creatinine value entered in the
                                    current frame.  The MUMPS code might also display the results of the calculation here, or set a variable so that it can be displayed in the next frame.  The code can be used for any purpose, and is generally used to
                                    accomplish tasks not within YSEXPERTS programmed abilities.
