              DESCRIPTION:
                                If this application processes ALL messages received on a particular listening port, then this field identifies the associated port number.  

              CROSS-REFERENCE:  21610.2^C 
                                1)= S ^VFD(21610.2,"C",$E(X,1,30),DA)=""

                                This cross-reference is used to select (or reject) a processing application for messages received via a particular listening port.

                                '1' FOR YES; 
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 01, 2007 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter YES if and only if this application uses message selection logic. 
              DESCRIPTION:      If this application processes a proper subset of messages received via a given port, or if it processes a subset of messages received via unspecified ports, the message selection logic (MUMPS code) must exist.  Indicate
                                that this application has such logic by answering YES to this cross-referenced field.  

              CROSS-REFERENCE:  21610.2^D 
                                1)= S ^VFD(21610.2,"D",$E(X,1,30),DA)=""
                                2)= K ^VFD(21610.2,"D",$E(X,1,30),DA)
                                This cross reference indicates the existence of message selection logic, thereby limiting the applications that are checked for such logic, to those that are indicated by the HAS SELECT LOGIC field value YES.

              LAST EDITED:      OCT 01, 2007 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field specifies the routine that this application runs to process a message.  The form is DO [TAG]^ROUTINE[(parameters)], where the [] indicate optional parts.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>245 X D:$D(X) ^DIM
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 01, 2007 
              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                The MUMPS code in this field should set $TEST.  If true, then the application's processing routine will be invoked to process the message.  If false, the processing routine will not be invoked.
