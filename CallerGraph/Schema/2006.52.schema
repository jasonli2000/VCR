                DESCRIPTION:
                                  The value of this field is a 'tag' as defined in the DICOM element dictionary.  Such a tag consists of 4 hexadecimal digits, a comma, and 4 more hexadecimal digits.  A 'tag' uniquely identifies a DICOM data element.

                INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>30!($L(X)<1) X
                LAST EDITED:      NOV 13, 1998 
                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the Required/Optional Type Codes for this element. 
                DESCRIPTION:      SCU stands for Service Class User; SCP stands for Service Class Provider.  
                                   
                                  The value of this field consists of two numeric parts, separated by a slash. The first piece is a code that specified whether or not the data element in this entry is required for an SCU; the second piece is a code that 
                                  specifies whether or not this data element is required for an SCP 
                                   
                                  The 'required' codes may be: 
                                     1: Always required 
                                     2: Required, but may be left 'empty' when not known 
                                     3: Optional 
                                   
                                  Any of these numeric codes may be followed by a letter C to indicate that the classification is conditional.  When this is the case, the DICOM standard spells out the conditions when the data element is required, and
                                  when not.

                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field, if non-empty, is the value that will be transmitted for this data element.  Normally, a value would be derived from the information that pertains to the patient or study at hand, in which case
                                  this field is left empty, but sometimes the value to be transmitted is a fixed value, in which case a value is entered in this field.
