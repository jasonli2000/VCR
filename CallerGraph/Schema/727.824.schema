This file contains data elements as specified by the Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office for the Laboratory Results extract from existing DHCP files. Entries into this file are made by extracting data from several files. Once approved by the DSS
site manager, entries in this file are loaded into an electronic mail message and sent to the commercial vendor. This file is intended to be used for validation purposes only. Entries should be made only by the extract load routine.  
  
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.  However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference, the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT
NUMBER field (#2).  This cross reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be modified.  
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the Patient's category which will be used for FHCC (Federal Health Care Center) Reconciliation.  DSS must capture and report DoD patients so that the FHCC reconciliation process can function as designed.
                                "Reconciliation" is the process used within the new FHCC to determine which patients DoD pays for and which VA pays for.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  If the VistA Patient Type Code (TYPE (#391) field of the Patient (#2) file) = Active Duty, Military Retiree, or TRICARE, then the value(s) in the VistA Other  Eligibility multiple (PATIENT ELIGIBILITIES (#361) field of the
                                PATIENT (#2) file), which points to locally modifiable ELIGIBILITY CODE (#8) file should be evaluated. If the value in the ELIGIBILITY CODE is equal to any entry in the set of codes in this field, the value should be
                                placed in this field.
