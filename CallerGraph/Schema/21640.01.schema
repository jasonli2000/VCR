              LAST EDITED:      APR 16, 2011 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is automatically set to 1 if PCE detects that any original SNOMED data is being edited.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                PCE filing logic automatically compares the before and after pictures of the record to determine if the edited flag should be set to "1".

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer is automatically entered by the PCE filing logic. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is populated automatically by the PCE filing logic.. The format of the field is as follows:  Pointer to PCE data source file_"-"_A for Add or E for Edit_" "_DUZ of the person who entered the data_";"...  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE filing logic requires a pointer to the PCE data source file.  If this is not passed, the PCE filing logic will not process the data.  
                                 
                                If the record is a new record, then an "A" is used to specify the source that added the data.  If the record existed previously, PCE filing logic compares the old and new records of information.  An "E" will be 
                                automatically used if the filing logic finds the data has been edited.  If "E" is used, then the Edited Flag field is automatically set to 1.  
                                 
                                The DUZ is stored in its internal format to represent the user who performed the adding or editing of data for this record.  
                                 
                                Iterations of editing will be concatenated to the previous data source value, up to 85 characters.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is the heading or category used to represent the provider narrative on the scanner form.  It may be useful for understanding how providers are grouping data for use on the encounter form, and may help determine
                                clinical data base definitions in the future.
