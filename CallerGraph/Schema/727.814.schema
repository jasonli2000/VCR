This file contains data elements as specified by the Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office for the Radiology extract from existing DHCP files. Entries into this file are made by extracting data from several files. Once approved by the DSS site
manager, entries in this file are loaded into an electronic mail message and sent to the commercial vendor. This file is intended to be used for validation purposes only. Entries should be made only by the extract load routine.  
  
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.  However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference, the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT
NUMBER field (#2).  This cross reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be modified.  
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  DSS IP# field value is determined via the following process:  The DSS PRODUCT DEPARTMENT AND IP NUMBER file (#727.6) is populated via site specific HL7 messages generated by AAC extracts which run on a monthly basis.  The
                                file is then used by the DSS extract routines to identify and to populate the DSS PRODUCT DEPARTMENT and DSS IP # fields in the DSS extract files before transmitting them to AAC. Using the combination of Feeder System,
                                Feeder Location and Feeder Key as an identifier for each individual record does the matches.  If no match is found an error message is generated and a bulletin is triggered and sent to a DSS mail group identifying the
                                problem.
