8925.99,.02   ENABLE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE 0;2 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 25, 2005 
              DESCRIPTION:      Electronic signature is enabled when this parameter is set to 1. Until such time as electronic signature is enabled, signatures are to be written on the chart copy of the TIU document, and provision must be made for TIU 
                                documents to be marked Signed on Chart.  


8925.99,.03   CHARACTERS PER LINE    0;3 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>80)!(X<10)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 25, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the number of characters per line, for line count computation (a # from 10 to 80). 
              DESCRIPTION:      This value (default 60) is divided into the total number of 'actual' characters in a given transcribed document to derive the line count for that document.  By 'actual' characters, we mean all printable ASCII characters,
                                with multiple white space characters stripped. This prevents transcriptionists from "stuffing" line counts by adding white space.  


8925.99,.04   GRACE PERIOD FOR PURGE 0;4 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>7300)!(X<90)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 25, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 90 and 7300, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      OUT OF SERVICE.  Purging is disabled.  
                                 
                                This is the number of days following transcription for which a document will be kept, prior to purge. Allowable range is from 90 to 7300 days (20 years).  
                                 
                                NOTE: Progress Notes and their addenda are not subject to purge, regardless of this parameter. IF YOU WANT TO DISABLE PURGING ALTOGETHER, LEAVE THIS PARAMETER EMPTY (or delete any existing value).  


8925.99,.05   GRACE PERIOD FOR SIGNATURE 0;5 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>10)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 25, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the number of days to wait before notifying physician of an overdue signature (1 to 10 days). 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the number of days following transcription before an author or Attending Physician is notified of a deficiency.  If no grace period is entered, clinicians are not notified of overdue signatures.  


8925.99,.06   OPTIMIZE LIST BUILDING FOR 0;6 SET

                                'P' FOR performance; 
                                'S' FOR security; 
              LAST EDITED:      JAN 25, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Please indicate whether Performance or Security should be optimized. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter determines whether or not TIU list building functions invoke business rules, excluding from the list any documents the user is not authorized to see.  Checking business rules in this way optimizes list
                                building for security.  It may be costly in terms of performance.  
                                 
                                When optimized for performance (the default behavior of TIU), business rules excluding notes from view are bypassed when building lists of documents.  
                                 
                                NOTE: This applies only to lists: when an unauthorized user attempts to view the contents of a document from the resulting list, he is prevented from doing so, with the following explanation: 
                                 
                                Reviewing Item #1 
                                 
                                 You may not VIEW this UNSIGNED NURSE'S NOTE.  
                                 
                                RETURN to continue...  


8925.99,.07   SUPPRESS REVIEW NOTES PROMPT 0;7 SET

                                '1' FOR YES; 
                                '0' FOR NO; 
              LAST EDITED:      MAR 20, 1997 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether to suppress the Review Notes prompt on entry 
              DESCRIPTION:      Applies to Progress Notes only.  When this parameter is set to YES, TIU suppresses the prompt which asks if the user wishes to see available progress notes before entering a new note.  This parameter is overridden by the
                                Personal Preference of same name.  If neither parameter is entered, the Review Notes prompt is NOT suppressed.  


8925.99,.08   DEFAULT PRIMARY PROVIDER 0;8 SET

                                '0' FOR NONE, DON'T PROMPT; 
                                '1' FOR DEFAULT, BY LOCATION; 
                                '2' FOR AUTHOR (IF PROVIDER); 
              LAST EDITED:      JUL 31, 1998 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Please indicate the source of the default for Primary Provider. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter determines the behavior of the Primary Provider prompt for a standalone encounter.  
                                 
                                If the parameter has no value, the prompt has no default. If the parameter has value 0, the user is not prompted for primary provider. If the parameter has value 1, the default for the Primary Provider prompt is the site's
                                default provider for the given location.  If the parameter has value 2, the default is the author if the author is a provider; if the author is not a provider, the prompt has no default.  


8925.99,.09   ASCII UPLOAD SOURCE    0;9 SET

                                'H' FOR host file server; 
                                'R' FOR remote computer; 
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 11, 1992 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Please specify the source of the ASCII data to be uploaded. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Applies only when the ASCII upload protocol is used. This field specifies the source from which documents are uploaded. (H)ost indicates to the upload processor that the source of the data is an ASCII host file (VMS or 
                                DOS), while (R)emote indicates that the data is read from an ASCII stream coming to VISTA from a terminal emulator on a remote computer (for example, an IBM PC or compatible, or an Apple Macintosh).  


8925.99,.1    RECORD HEADER SIGNAL   0;10 FREE TEXT

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>10!($L(X)<1) X
              LAST EDITED:      FEB 11, 1993 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 1-10 characters to distinguish a record's header from its report text. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a free text tag or signal used by the upload process to determine that a new document record header has been encountered.  It may be as simple as the three-character string "MSH" or as complex as "HEADERBEGIN".  
                                The signal "@@@", used by the Surgery Package option to transmit operative notes, is another possibility.  
                                 
                                NOTE: Although you may define this parameter independently for each DIVISION, we recommend that you choose just one such signal per site.  


8925.99,.11   END OF MESSAGE SIGNAL  0;11 FREE TEXT

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>10!($L(X)<3) X
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 19, 1992 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 3-10 characters to signal end of upload message. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Applies only to transfers made using the ASCII protocol.  This is the free text signal to the upload process that the entire file/stream has been transmitted without difficulty, and no more lines of data need to be read.  


8925.99,.12   BEGIN REPORT TEXT SIGNAL 0;12 FREE TEXT

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>10!($L(X)<1) X
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 19, 1992 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 1-10 characters to delimit report text from record header. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the signal to the upload processor that the fixed-field header for a given report record has been fully read, and that the body of the narrative report follows.  


8925.99,.13   MAJOR DELIMITER        0;13 FREE TEXT

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>1!($L(X)<1)!'(X?1P) X
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 20, 1992 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the major delimiter of the message header. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This ASCII character separates the various pieces of fixed-field information in the message header. Please avoid using delimiters such as ",", or ":", which may be contained within the data itself, using instead less
                                common symbols such as "|", "\" or "~".| 


8925.99,.14   FUTURE APPOINTMENT RANGE 0;14 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>180)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 14, 1998 
              HELP-PROMPT:      How many days in advance may future appointments be selected? 
              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter determines how far in advance a future appointment may be selected when entering a document for outpatient care.  
                                 
                                Allowable values range from 1 to 180 days, defaulting to 1 day.  


8925.99,.15   PACE CHARACTER         0;15 FREE TEXT

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>3!($L(X)<1) X S:X'?1.3N X=$A(X)
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 20, 1992 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the character used to prompt the remote for another line of text. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Applies only to transfers which use the ASCII protocol.  
                                 
                                This is the ASCII value of the character which VISTA sends to the remote computer to acknowledge receipt of the previous text line and to prompt the remote to transmit another line. You may choose any character with an 
                                ASCII value between 1 and 126.  
                                 
                                If you are using the same remote to upload both MailMan messages and textual reports, then we recommend using the ">" symbol, ASCII 62.  Otherwise, we suggest using the ACK character (ASCII 6).  
                                 
                                NOTE: you may need to specify the same character as part of the ASCII PROTOCOL parameters of the terminal emulation software on the remote.

8925.99,1.05  AMENDMENT SIGNATURE BLOCK 1;5 FREE TEXT

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>80!($L(X)<3) X
              LAST EDITED:      OCT 26, 1992 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the Privacy Act Officer's signature block. 
              DESCRIPTION:      OUT OF SERVICE.  The signer's normal signature block is used for amendments.  
                                 
                                This parameter allows the site to specify the format of the signature block for an amendment. 
                                 
                                While Business Rules determine who may amend documents, generally it is the user class CHIEF,MIS who may do so. If this user is not the site's Privacy Act officer, then it may be desirable to enter a statement indicating
                                that the user is signing on behalf of the Privacy Act Officer.  
                                 
                                For example, if the user's name is John Smith, while the site's Privacy Act Officer is Jane Doe, RRT, then the AMENDMENT SIGNATURE BLOCK might be entered as: "for Jane Doe, RRT, PRIVACY ACT OFFICER".  
                                 
                                The amendment information on the document would then appear as:
