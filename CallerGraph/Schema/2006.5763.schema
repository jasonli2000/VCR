As messages are being processed by VistA DICOM Text Gateways, statistics are being logged about the number and nature of the events that cause these messages.  
 
The entries in this file keep track of how many transactions occurred for each accession number being processed, and how many events were processed for each accession number.

                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string that represents an accession number. Accession numbers are encoded as: 
                                   first a sequence of 6 digits that represent the date 
                                   then a dash

                  HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a code that identifies an event. 
                  DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string that represents a code for an event. Possible values for such strings depend on the nature of the transactions with the various PACSs and are determined by the software at run-time
                                    (see routine MAGDAUD3 for the determination of valid codes for events).

                  DESCRIPTION:
                                    The value of this field is a date/time string that represents a time-stamp for the occurrence of the event that is described in the current record.

                  HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a code for the type of event. 
                  DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a code for the type of imaging activity.  
                                     
                                    The value for this field is obtained from the HL7 message that was transmitted for this event.  
                                     
                                    Typical values are codes like: 
                                       ANI 
                                       CT

                                    Since any value obtained from an HL7 message will be considered valid when entering data into this file, this field is typed as "free text", rather than as a "set of codes".
