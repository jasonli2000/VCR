                  DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the request number from the record tracking system.  It will only have a request number if the clinic requires records for an appointment and if the site is utilitizing the record tracking module.  
                                     
                                    The request number represents the 'parent' request for records. This parent request may then, in turn, indicate that more than one record request is associated with this appointment. For example, if the patient's 
                                    medical record has two volumes then there maybe a request issued for each volume.  
                                     
                                    The request for volume 1 maybe the initial(parent) request and the request for the second volume would have volumes 1's request as its parent.  
                                     
                                    Also, requests for x-ray film folders, dental records etc. maybe linked to this parent request.
