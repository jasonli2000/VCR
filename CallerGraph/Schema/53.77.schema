              DESCRIPTION:      The type of scan event.  The value stored is one of a FileMan set.  The value that is placed here is determined by the user's actions when attempting to scan a medication/wristband during an administration.  Those types
                                beginning with the "M" are events dealing with medications; those beginning with "W" are events with wristbands. "*UAS"  occur when the user actually uses the "unable to scan" functionality to document the activity. 
                                "*SCN" are types that occur during normal scanning activities.  The "*KEY" designate a type of event where the user has by-passed the BCMA scanning system by "keying", via the system's keyboard device, BCMA input data.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The order number from Pharmacy Patient, with a "U" or "V" appended to specify an order type of Unit Dose or IV order. This is only recorded if the order number is available and meaningful to the UTS event. Because of the
                                appended letter, this is not a pointer strictly speaking.
