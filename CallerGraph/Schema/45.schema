                                  information. The PTF EXPANDED CODE FILE (45.89) contains all ICD's that require special processing.  If a match is made an entry is made in the DGBPC array.  3) If the DGBPC array exist then additional questions are
                                  required to complete the data entry for a particular ICD. This flag is then used to prompt the user for any additional information.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The process for loading this field consist of the following steps: 1) Load the DGPTIT array with the ICD codes from the PTF <401>, <501> or the <701> screen.  2) Scan the DGPTIT array for codes that require additional
                                information. The PTF EXPANDED CODE FILE contains all ICD's that require special processing.  If a match is made an entry is made in the DGBPC array.  3) If the DGBPC array exist then additional questions are required to
                                complete the data entry for a particular ICD. This flag is then used to prompt the user for any additional information.

      Short Descr:  Clinical Reminders Index for ICD diagnosis code lookup.
      Description:  This cross-reference builds two indexes, one for finding all patients with a particular ICD diagnosis code and one for finding all the ICD diagnosis codes a patient has.  The indexes are stored in the Clinical Reminders Index global
                    as: 
                     ^PXRMINDX(45,CODESYS,"INP",CODE,NAME,DFN,DATE,DAS) and 
                     ^PXRMINDX(45,CODESYS,"PNI",DFN,NAME,CODE,DATE,DAS) respectively.  CODESYS is the standard three-character abbreviation for the coding system.  DATE is the discharge date. If it does not exist then the admission date is used.  NAME is
                    the name of the field where the code is stored. An example is DXLS.  If the TYPE OF RECORD is CENSUS then the entry is not indexed.  For complete details, see the Clinical Reminders Index Technical Guide/Programmer's Manual.
