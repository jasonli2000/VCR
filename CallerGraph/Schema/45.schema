                                  information. The PTF EXPANDED CODE FILE (45.89) contains all ICD's that require special processing.  If a match is made an entry is made in the DGBPC array.  3) If the DGBPC array exist then additional questions are
                                  required to complete the data entry for a particular ICD. This flag is then used to prompt the user for any additional information.

                TECHNICAL DESCR:The process for loading this field consist of the following steps: 1) Load the DGPTIT array with the ICD codes from the PTF <401>, <501> or the <701> screen.  2) Scan the DGPTIT array for codes that require additional
                                information. The PTF EXPANDED CODE FILE (45.89) contains all ICD's that require special processing.  If a match is made an entry is made in the DGBPC array.  3) If the DGBPC array exist then additional questions are
                                required to complete the data entry for a particular ICD. This flag is then used to prompt the user for any additional information.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The process for loading this field consist of the following steps: 1) Load the DGPTIT array with the ICD codes from the PTF <401>, <501> or the <701> screen.  2) Scan the DGPTIT array for codes that require additional
                                information. The PTF EXPANDED CODE FILE contains all ICD's that require special processing.  If a match is made an entry is made in the DGBPC array.  3) If the DGBPC array exist then additional questions are required to
                                complete the data entry for a particular ICD. This flag is then used to prompt the user for any additional information.

                    is a discharge secondary diagnosis.  If the TYPE OF RECORD is CENSUS then the entry is not indexed.  For all the details, see the Clinical Reminders Index Technical Guide/Programmer's Manual.
