This file contains data elements as specified by the Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office for the Nursing extract from existing DHCP files. Entries into this file are made by extracting data from several files. Once approved by the DSS site
manager, entries in this file are loaded into an electronic mail message and sent to the commercial vendor. This file is intended to be used for validation purposes only. Entries should be made only by the extract load routine.  
  
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.  However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference, the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT
NUMBER field (#2).  This cross reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be modified.  
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                The PTF CODE of the treating specialty associated with this extract record.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is initialized to a null, indicating an outpatient status. If a call to IN5^VADPT (using the patient IEN and the event date) returns a patient movement number (indicating inpatient status), then the value of 
                                VAIP(8), which is the pointer to the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY file (#45.7), is used to get the SPECIALTY field (1) which points to the SPECIALTY file (#42.4).  Then, the PTF Code (field #7 of file 42.4) is obtained and
                                stored instead of the IEN of the specialty.
