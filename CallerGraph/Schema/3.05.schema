Once the maximum sign-on attempts limit has been exceeded, an entry will be made in this file to record all available information about the failed sign-on attempt.  Information includes the date/time, CPU, UCI, device, and, if known, user.  The text
entered for each attempt is recorded when it does not match existing codes such that security is not violated.  This file is not cross-referenced.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  S %DT="ETXR" D ^%DT S X=Y K:Y<1 X
              DESCRIPTION:
                                Entries in this file are uniquely identified by the precise time of the failed access attempt.

              LAST EDITED:      APR 06, 1988 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field holds a pointer to the Device File to identify the device in use at the time of the failed access attempt.

              HELP-PROMPT:      ANSWER MUST BE 1-10 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field identifies the CPU/Volume Set where the failed access attempt occurred.  


3.05,2        TYPE OF FAILED ATTEMPT 0;3 SET

                                'D' FOR DEVICE; 
                                'V' FOR VERIFY; 
                                'A' FOR ACCESS; 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field identifies the type of access failure.  For example, if the access code passes the type of access is VERIFY and only the text entered in guessing the verify code is stored.  


3.05,3        NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS     0;4 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>100)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              HELP-PROMPT:      TYPE A WHOLE NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field records the number of unsuccessful attempts that were made before the device locked.  The ^DISV global maintains a count of the current unsuccessful attempts.  A lock results when the number of default attempts
                                (set in the Kernel Site Parameters File) is reached.  If the default is reached an entry is made in this file.

              HELP-PROMPT:      ANSWER MUST BE 1-10 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field identifies the UCI account location of the failed access attempt.

              LAST EDITED:      SEP 08, 1989 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is used when an access code is entered which matches one on file.  The associated user's name may then be recorded.

              ALGORITHM:        INTERNAL(USER)
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field retrieves the user number from the User File to facilitate report display.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>20!($L(X)<2) X
              LAST EDITED:      MAR 29, 1989 
              HELP-PROMPT:      The DECserver port info at sign-on. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field (if filled in) is the $ZIO value from VAX-DSM to show the DECserver port that was trying to sign-on.  On MSM systems with LAT servers it will have the $ZDEV value.  


3.05,7        TEXT ENTERED           1;0 Multiple #3.051 (Add New Entry without Asking)

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This subfile holds the text of the unsuccessful attempts.

                HELP-PROMPT:      ANSWER MUST BE 1-250 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH 
                DESCRIPTION:
                                  This field holds the text that was entered during an unsuccessful log-on attempt.  Text that matches existing codes is not recorded to prevent discovery of valid codes.
