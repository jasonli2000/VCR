                    LAST EDITED:      MAR 26, 1991 
                    DESCRIPTION:        This should be the next smallest area of the laboratory service after the MAJ. SECT. This field is used to further break down the workload.  
                                         Generally this will be the ACCESSION area into which the order was accessioned. However, this may not be always true. To allow for flexibility in this matter, this field is controlled by the worklist used during 
                                      the verification process.  
                                         Even if the verification method used itself, does not require a work list, one can control this field via that worklist. There are two new fields in the LOAD/WORK LIST file (#68.2). One of these fields is MAJOR
                                      ACCESSION AREA. What ever value is entered here will be used to tabulate the workload for this test. If none is entered the test accession area will be used.

                    LAST EDITED:      MAR 26, 1991 
                    DESCRIPTION:        This field represents the smallest functional unit of the laboratory service. If there is a area smaller than the MAJ. ACC AREA, enter that area here. Not all laboratories will have a smaller work area. If the 
                                      field is blank the MAJ. ACC AREA will be used. For example the MAJ. ACC AREA may be CHEMISTRY and the LAB SUBSECTION could be STAT LAB 
                                       Of course these must exist in the ACCESSION AREA file and may be used only for this purpose.  
                                        This field is also works like the MAJ. ACC AREA, in that it is attached to a LOAD/WORK LIST. It is controlled by selecting a worklist during verification.
