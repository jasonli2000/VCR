                                 Major accession area           Default is the accession area of the test.  
                                 Lab Subsection                 Default is the Major accession area.  
                                 Work Area                      Default is the Lab Subsection.  
                                 
                                  If none of these fields are filled in, then the default answer for all is the accession area of the test. This means the reports will not be broken down into separate areas for any management reports.

                  LAST EDITED:  AUG 17, 2004 
                  HELP-PROMPT:  Enter the workload method suffix to be associated with this POC test. 
                  DESCRIPTION:  Designates the WKLD method suffix to be assigned to this Point of Care (POC) test results when this test is ordered. This allows multiple POC vendor systems to be interfaced to VistA via one POC interface and still assign
                                the appropriate methodology to the test result.

                                This is the default accession area to use to build the load/work list.

                  HELP-PROMPT:  Select how verifying by UID will select accessions. 
                  DESCRIPTION:  When verifying by Lab Universal Identifier (UID) the site can configure how accessions are selected.  
                                 
                                If "PROFILE ACCESSION AREA ONLY" is selected then only those UIDs which are from the accession area designated for this profile can be selected.  
                                 
                                If "ANY ACCESSION AREA" is selected then a UID from any accession area can be selected. Note that an accession from a different area should have tests that would be in this editing profile.

                  HELP-PROMPT:  Should duplicate comments be stored with results. 
                  DESCRIPTION:  When the Laboratory result verifying software is processing comments associated with a load/work list result, this field determines how duplicate comments are processed. If set to "NO" (default if no value) then a comment
                                that matches a previously stored comment will not be stored with the result.  If set to "YES" then the duplicate check is not performed and the comment is stored with the results irregardless if the comment already exists.  
                                 
                                Setting it to "YES" will allow the handling of multiple line comments which contain the same comment more than once and are still clinically significant.
