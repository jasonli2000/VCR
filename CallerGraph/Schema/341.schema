This file contains events that occurred to a debtor's account.  This file should NEVER be edited directly.  Eventually all types of events will be stored in this file as the Accounts Receivable package moves to a transaction-based system.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.

              LAST EDITED:      MAY 31, 1993 
              DESCRIPTION:      The event type describes the type of event that occurred for a debtor by storing all events that occur for this debtor.  This allows better reporting capabilities, financial integrity, and history recreation.  
                                 
                                In version 4.0 of AR, the only types of events that are tracked under this new system are notification type events (letters, UBs, and patient statements) and comments.  Eventually, payments, refunds, etc. will be tracked
                                in this new file but are currently being tracked in the Accounts Receivable transaction file.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This debtor field is used to store what debtor this event belongs to.  By storing events by debtor, this will allow a more efficient system when trying to re-create the activity for a debtor account.

                                This cross reference is used to store events that are in an open status.  Since only one event at a time should be in an open status for a debtor, this cross reference makes sure that no two events are in an open status 
                                for a debtor.

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 09, 1993 
              DESCRIPTION:      The Date/Time of event represents the date the event occurred.  For example, if a user is logging a comment against a debtor account for the previous day, then this field would be dated for that day and not the day it is
                                being entered.  This allows the user to back-date events that occurred in the past.

              LAST EDITED:      MAY 31, 1993 
              DESCRIPTION:      The date/time an event is closed is the time the AR package 'recognizes' the event as being closed and complete.  An event has two status, OPEN and CLOSED.  While a transaction is in a status of 'OPEN' the AR package does
                                not recognize the transaction.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                The site field represents the site that the event belongs to.  This field would be used when multiple divisional sites are supported and will allow events to be 'traced' to a particular site.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 30, 1993 
              DESCRIPTION:      The status of an event is either OPEN or CLOSED.  When an event for a debtor is in an 'OPEN' status, this means that activity is occurring and has not completed.  After the activity is completed, the event would be changed
                                to a status of CLOSED.

                                For example, if a patient calls and needs information that is not readily available, a user can enter as a comment with a follow-up date as a 'reminder' to return the information to the patient.
