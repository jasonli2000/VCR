              DESCRIPTION:      This flag is related to NON-BILLABLE REASONs that are marked with ECME FLAG to be used as ECME CLOSE CLAIM REASON. If this field 'ECME PAPER FLAG' is set to 'YES', it indicates that the NON BILLABLE REASON may be
                                potentially billable "on paper". When the ECME user (OPECC) is closing the e-Pharmacy claim and enters the NON BILLABLE REASON as a CLOSE CLAIM REASON, the additional prompt will be issued to the user - should the claim be
                                billed "on paper"?
