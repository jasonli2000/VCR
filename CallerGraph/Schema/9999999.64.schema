              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to inactivate a health factor type. If this field contains a "1" then the health factor is inactive.  Inactive health factors cannot be selected in the manual data entry process.  Health factor entries

                                This inactive flag should be used, rather than deleting entries in the health factor file, since there may be other files pointing at the health factor entry.
