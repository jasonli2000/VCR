This file simply keeps an ordered list of all the prescriptions that have been put on suspense for a certain date.  It is typically used to print all prescriptions on suspense for a given date range, usually in order of entry.  After an entry has been
printed, a printed flag is set to keep it from being inadvertantly reprinted.  
 
The outpatient pharmacy package supplies an option to clean out printed prescriptions that have accumulated over time.  This is up to the center to determine when it will routinely perform this task.

                                This cross-reference is used for batching suspense prints, so different batches within a day can be reset. This cross-reference also sets the 'APR' cross-reference. The 'APR' cross-reference will list CMOP Rx's by batch
                                for reseting. Only the 'AS' or the 'APR' will exist for an Rx.  For non-CMOP prescriptions, it sets the global ^PS(52.5,"AS",Print Date,Printed By,Division,Sequence,DA)="".  For CMOP prescriptions, it sets the global
