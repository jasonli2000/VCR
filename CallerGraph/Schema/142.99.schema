              DESCRIPTION:      This parameter is to be used in conjunction with the Hospital Location Health Summary [GMTS HS BY LOC] report to shorten the cover page for each location.  When printing in standard Letter (8.5 x 11) format, the name of
                                the hospital location is printed six times which results in an overflow onto the next page.  If this parameter is set to 'Y' the name will only print one time, thus saving paper.
