This file contains data elements as specified by the Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office for the MAS Treating Specialty Change extract from existing DHCP files. Entries into this file are made by extracting data from several files. Once approved
by the DSS site manager, entries in this file are loaded into an electronic mail message and sent to the commercial vendor. This file is intended to be used for validation purposes only. Entries should be made only by the extract load routine.  
  
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.  However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference, the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT
NUMBER field (#2).  This cross reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be modified.  
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                The patient's length of stay with the losing primary ward provider.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PRIMARY WARD PROVIDER LOS is determined by looping through both the treating specialty/provider change movements and the discharge movements of the PATIENT MOVEMENT file (#405).  
                                 
                                For each movement, a call is made to PREVPRV^ECXTRT1.  If the primary provider has changed since the last movement, or if the movement is a discharge, then the call returns the length of stay (LOS) to be associated with
                                the primary provider of the previous movement.  For the treating specialty/provider change movement associated with an admission, this field will be left blank.  This field will also be blank if the primary provider for
                                the current movement or the previous movement cannot be determined.  Maximum value for this field is 9999.
