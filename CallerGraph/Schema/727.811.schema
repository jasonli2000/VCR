This file contains data elements as specified by the Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office for the Surgery extract from existing DHCP files. Entries into this file are made by extracting data from several files. Once approved by the DSS site
manager, entries in this file are loaded into an electronic mail message and sent to the commercial vendor. This file is intended to be used for validation purposes only. Entries should be made only by the extract load routine.  
  
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.  However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference, the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT
NUMBER field (#2).  This cross reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be modified.  
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.

                                third piece returns: 
                                 
                                 1 - vet was eligible on date specified

              DESCRIPTION:
                                ROOM CLEANING TIME is the number of 15 minute intervals required to clean the room.  For example, an entry of 3 indicates that it took 45 minutes to clean the room.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The ROOM CLEANING TIME is determined by using the OR CLEAN START TIME field (#.234), OR CLEAN END TIME field (#.236) and the TIME PAT OUT OR field (#.232) of the SURGERY file (#130).  
                                 
                                If the OR CLEAN START TIME and the OR CLEAN END TIME field have values, then they are used to determine the amount of time to clean the room. If that yields no result then the OR CLEAN END TIME and the TIME PAT OUT OR 
                                fields are used.  If that yields no result then the default value will be 2.

                                This is derived by subtracting the TIME PT IN HOLD AREA from TIME PT IN OR and converting the result into the number of 15-minute increments.  If the TIME PT IN HOLD AREA = 0 or null, set the extract field to null.

                                This field records that the patient's record contains 1 or more Category 1 (National) Patient Record Flags.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The NATIONAL PATIENT RECORD FLAG field is set based on the results of the $$GETACT^DGPFAPI(DFN,TARGET ARRAY) call.  This call looks at the category 1 national patient record flags as recorded in the PRF NATIONAL FLAG file 
                                (#26.15). The resulting value of this call is the number of active category I patient record flags assigned to this patient. This field is set to Y (YES) if the result is greater than zero.  A value of zero causes this
                                field to be left null.
