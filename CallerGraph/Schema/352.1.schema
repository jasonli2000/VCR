              DESCRIPTION:      Every Appointment type has certain billing characteristics that may change over time.  For example, an appointment type may not be billable for Category C Means Test billing one year but may the next depending on
                                legislation.  
                                 
                                It is only necessary to add a new effective date for an appointment type if the characteristics need to be time sensitive.
