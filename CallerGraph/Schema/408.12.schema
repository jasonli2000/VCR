This file contains all relations of a veteran, including the veteran himself/herself.  Demographic data (name, SSN, date of birth, and sex) can be found in either the PATIENT file (if the relation is a veteran) or in the INCOME PERSON file (if the
relation is not a veteran).  A single individual may be entered in this file more than once of that individual is related to more than one veteran.  An example would be a spouse that was a veteran.  One entry would exist for the veteran himself and one
as the husband of his veteran wife.  This would also hold true for children of two veteran parents.  
 
This file relates all relations for a veteran to the veteran.  These relations are date sensitive and can be activated and inactivated.  
 
Data in this file is utilized by the income screening and means test portions of MAS.  It should be edited through those applications and not through direct access through VA FileMan.
