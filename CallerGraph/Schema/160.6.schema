SURGICAL APPROACH describes the method used to approach the surgical field.  Use codes 1-9 only if the patient had cancer-directed surgery of the primary site.  Use code 0 if the patient did not have cancer-directed surgery of the primary site.  
 
Use code 9 for TURP, TURB, and colonoscope with polypectomy, etc.  
 
This item records information on the increasing use of less invasive procedures.  The data will make possible a comparative analysis of traditional and laparoscopic approaches.
