The DICOM RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES file (#2006.5758) contains the list of orderable radiology procedures, along with related data that is needed for the Importer to place orders on VistA.  
 
This file resides on the DICOM Gateway and several of the fields will be redundantly storing the same information for pointer fields.  This is required to continue image processing when a VistA connection is lost.  
 
Information in this file is a combination of data from files RAD/NUC MED PROCEDUES (#71) and OUTSIDE IMAGE LOCATION (#2006.5759).  The data in this file will be periodically updated via a remote procedure file to VistA.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the CPT CODE defined for the procedure in file RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURE (#71).  The information is obtained from field CPT CODE (#9) in the RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURE FILE (#71).  Field #9 in file #71 is a pointer to the
                                CPT CODE file (#81); however the remote procedure called to update this file (#2006.5758) will interpret the field and bring in the actual CPT CODE value instead of the pointer value.

                                The remote procedure that updates this file (#2006.5758) will marry the TYPE OF IMAGING value for the procedure to the TYPE OF IMAGING value for the appropriate OUTSIDE IMAGING LOCATION in file (2006.5759).  
                                 
                                For each outside location it should have a TYPE OF IMAGING and for each TYPE OF IMAGING a set of radiology procedures must be defined.
