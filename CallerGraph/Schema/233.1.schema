              DESCRIPTION:      This is a unique name for a value in a selection list used by the patient tracking system.  Each name is made unique by a prefix.  This prefix is "edp." for nationally exported names.  Names that are added by the site are
                                prefixed with the station number and a period -- "500.", for example.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the national code that most closely matches this local code. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This will allow a mapping from a site defined code to a national code when such a code exists.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-4 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The flags are used to further classify a specific code.  The possible flags are: 
                                 
                                   M: Missed Opportunity

                                Multiple flags are allowed.  No delimiters are required, as each character has a specific meaning.  In the case of "VA", the "A" indicates an admission and the "V" indicates that the admission was to the VA.
