                                called 'air kerma'.

              DESCRIPTION:      Air Kerma Area Product is defined as the air kerma at a particular location in an x-ray beam multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the beam at that location. It is an approximate indication of the total amount of
                                energy delivered by the x-ray beam.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the total amount of time the patient was exposed to fluoroscopy sourced radiation. This value must be a number from 0 to 99999, 2 decimal digits. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The ability of fluoroscopy to display motion is provided by a continuous series of images produced per second. High radiation exposures to patients can result from multiple series of images.  
                                 
                                Therefore, total fluoroscopic time is one of the metrics that determines the exposure to the patient from fluoroscopy.

                DESCRIPTION:
                                  An irradiation event is the occurrence of radiation being applied to a patient in a single continuous time-frame between the start (release) and the stop (cease) of the irradiation.  

                TECHNICAL DESCR:  The Irradiation Instance UID is defined as a character string containing a UID that is used to uniquely identify a wide variety of items. The UID is a series of numeric components separated by the period "." character.

                                  For example, you might need a CT scan of the brain, liver, kidneys, or lungs. The target areas of CT scans are usually sinuses, the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvic regions.

                DESCRIPTION:      The Computed Tomography Dose Index volume (CTDIvol) is approximately the average dose that would have been delivered to a standard cylindrical plastic phantom for a specific examination. One phantom is used for head 
                                  scans and another larger diameter phantom is used for body scans.  The CTDIvol must be adjusted for body size and other factors to estimate the dose to the scanned volume of a actual patient.  However, the CTDIvol is 
                                  very useful for comparing and adjusting CT imaging protocols.
