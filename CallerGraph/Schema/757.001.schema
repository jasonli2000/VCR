              LAST EDITED:      JUL 26, 1995 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is a pointer to the Major Concept (file #757) and used to link the concept frequency of use back to the Major Concept.

                                ^LEX(757.001,"B",MC,IEN) - where MC is the pointer to the Major Concept in the Major Concept Map file #757 and IEN is the Internal Entry Number in the Concept Usage file #757.001 where the Major Concept is located.

              DESCRIPTION:      It was necessary to "seed" this file prior to export.  This field represents the original (exported) value of the frequency of use (Usage, field #2).  To obtain the actual frequency of use, this value must be subtracted
                                from the Frequency field (#2).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 0 and 9999999999, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This value is incremented each time the user selects a concept from the Lexicon using the Special Lookup Routines supplied with the Lexicon Utility.  Over time, it will show the frequency of use of each of the concepts
                                contained in the Lexicon.  Additionally, it is used to order the selection list in the Special Lookup Routines, placing the most frequently used concepts at the top of the list.

                                #757.001 where this frequency value is located.
