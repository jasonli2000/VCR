              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the UID for this entry. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string that conforms to the format of a DICOM UID (Unique Object Identifier).  A UID is a string that consists of only digits and periods.  The first and the last characters must be digits, and
                                none of the integer numbers in the string (that are separated by periods) may have leading or trailing zeroes.  
                                 
                                The meanings of UIDs are defined in the DICOM standard.

                                The DICOM standard currently identifies the following possible values:

              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate a sub-type (if any) for this UID. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string that identifies a sub-type for the UID. Sub-types are not defined in the DICOM standard but are used to distinguish between application-specific usages of UIDs.  
                                 
                                For instance, an UID that has a "type" of "SOP Class" may have a "sub-type" of "Storage".

                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string. This string identifies an action that may be executed by the application software.  
                                   
                                  Depending on the UID of the object being manipulated, the application will find in this table which specific action is to be executed for which specific purpose.

                LAST EDITED:      NOV 02, 2007 
                HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-10 characters in length. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string. This string identifies the action to be taken by the application for this purpose for this UID.  
                                   
                                  Since the value in this field by be used by an application that runs on VistA, as well as by a client-application that acquires this value through a remote procedure, no assumption can be made about the mechanism that
                                  may be used to invoke the software to perform this action (it may be MUMPS, Delphi, Java, et cetera).  
                                   
                                  Hence, the value in this field will be a numeric code. The meaning of this code is specific to each purpose for which an action may be taken.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a comment that describes this action. 
                DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a string.  The value that will be used by the applications to determine which action to take is taken from a different field in this record (ACTION).  
                                   
                                  In order to facilitate debugging and consistency checking, a semi free text is entered in this field that described the action to take in a human-readable form.
