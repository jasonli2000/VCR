This file contains entries that are generated during a supervisors certification.  When an employee's 8B string contains more overtime than approved overtime in the requests file, a warning message is displayed to the supervisor before certifying the
timecard.  If the supervisor certifies the timecard without resolving the warning then the warning is filed in this file.  The entries are for either week 1 or week 2 of a pay period.

                                Trigger ensures that whenever an overtime warning is filed that it's status is set to active. The conditional expression ensures that the status is not triggered unless it is a new overtime warning entry and won't reset
                                status if the trigger is reindexed.
