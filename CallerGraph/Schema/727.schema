This file contains data about the extracts from DHCP packages.  Each entry includes the date of the extract, the package for which the extract was run, the date range covered by the extract, and the number of records sent.  Data is entered into this file
by the extract routines at the time extracts are transmitted to the commercial software.  Data in this file may be viewed by appropriate options within the DSS package.  It is not intended that this file be read directly via VA FileMan and DATA IN THIS
FILE MUST NEVER BE EDITED.  Editing data in this file will severely compromise the integrity of all DSS applications.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field holds the message number of a message for this extract which was sent to the Austin Automation Center.  It is created by routine ECXTRANS when the message was transmitted and deleted by routine ECXMDELE when
                                  the confirmation message is received from the Austin Automation Center.  A necessary and sufficient condition for an extract to have been successfully transmitted to the Austin Automation Center is the existence of
                                  TRANSMITTED field (#300) and no entries in this multiple.  

                TECHNICAL DESCR:  Created at line SETM^ECXTRANS at the time of transmission to the Austin Automation Center and deleted at line DEL^ECXMDELE when the confirmation message is received from the Austin Automation Center.  For this deletion
                                  to occur, the server option S.ECXMDELE@<this site> must be a remote member of the mail group DMS.
