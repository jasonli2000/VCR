This file is populated with information originating from the automated supply station HL7 transactions. Once the data stored here has been processed by GIP and the GIP files have been updated appropriately, the record will be deleted.  This file allows
information from the supply stations to flow to GIP even if the file 445 entry for a particular secondary inventory point is in use.
