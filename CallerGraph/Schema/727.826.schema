This file contains the data elements as specified by the Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office for the Prosthetics extract from existing VISTA files.  Entries into this file are made by extracting data that originates in the Prosthetics RECORD OF
PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR file (#660).  Information respective to the patient for which Prosthetic information is extracted is pulled from the PIMS Patient file (#2).  Once the extracts (making up the records in this file) are approved by the extract
manager, entries in this file are loaded into mail messages and transmitted to the commercial vendor.  This file is intended to be used for validation purposes only.  Entries in this file should be made only by the extract load routine.  
 
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.  However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference, the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT
NUMBER field (#2).  This cross reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be modified.  
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  To determine the value of this field a call is made to $$PATDEM^ECXUTL2. Within this call, $$INP^ECXUTL2 is called to determine inpatient/outpatient status.  If the patient is an outpatient, processing stops and the field
                                is set to O.   If the patient is an inpatient then $$INOUTP^ECXUTL4 is called to look at the treating specialty.  If the patient's treating specialty exists in the DSS TREATING SPECIALTY TRANSLATION (#727.831) file then
                                the value of the INPAT/OUTPAT CODE field (#5) of the DSS TREATING SPECIALTY TRANSLATION (#727.831) file is used.  If the treating specialty is not found in the DSS TREATING SPECIALTY TRANSLATION (#727.831) file then the

              DESCRIPTION:
                                Code that uniquely identifies a DSS product.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  FEEDER KEY is the concatenation of the following elements.  They are listed in the order they are to appear in the FEEDER KEY.  
                                 
                                 1) HCPCS Code - This is the 5-digit HCPCS Code in the patient's 
                                    prosthetic record.  
                                 
                                 2) Type of Transaction - This is the Type of Transaction code in the 
                                    patient's prosthetic record.  
                                   (a) If Type of Transaction in the patient's prosthetic record is "X" 
                                       (Repair), the Type of Transaction code in the FEEDER KEY is X.  
                                   (b) If the Type of Transaction in the patient's prosthetic record is 
                                       "I" (Initial Issue),  "R" (Replace) or "S" (Spare), the Type of 
                                       Transaction code in the FEEDER KEY is N.  
                                   (c) If the Type of Transaction in the patient's prosthetic record is 
                                       "5" (Rental), the Type of Transaction code in the FEEDER KEY is R.  
                                   (d) Type of Transaction is considered the first suffix of the FEEDER 
                                       KEY.  
                                 3) Source - This is the Source in the patient's prosthetic record.  
                                   (a) If Source in the patient's prosthetic record is VA, the Source code 
                                       in the FEEDER KEY is V (VA).  
                                   (b) If Source in the patient's prosthetic record is Commercial, the 
                                       Source code in the FEEDER KEY is C (Commercial).  
                                   (c) Source is considered the second suffix of the FEEDER KEY.  
                                 
                                 4) Station - If this is a Lab Transaction, the station is either the 
                                    Requesting or Receiving Station.  
                                   (a) 3-digit Receiving Station concatenated with REC if the FEEDER 
                                       LOCATION ends in ORD, or 
                                   (b) 5-digit Receiving Station (includes the 2-letter division suffix) 
                                       concatenated with REC if the FEEDER LOCATION ends in ORD, or 
                                   (c) 3-digit Requesting Station concatenated with REQ if the FEEDER 
                                       LOCATION ends in LAB, or 
                                   (d) 5-digit Requesting Station (includes the 2-letter division suffix) 
                                       concatenated with REQ if the FEEDER LOCATION ends in LAB.  
                                   (e) Station is considered the third suffix of the FEEDER KEY.  
                                 
                                 5) If this is a Non-Lab Transaction, there is no third suffix for the 
                                    FEEDER KEY.  Data for the FEEDER KEY is derived from the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR file (#660).  Depending how the FEEDER KEY is constructed, the components for the FEEDER KEY are derived from the following
                                fields in the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR file (#660): 
                                 
                                 1) HCPCS (#4.1) - HCPCS is a pointer to the CPT CODE field (#.01) of the 
                                    CPT file (#81)

              DESCRIPTION:
                                PATIENT ELIGIBILITY is the patient's primary eligibility code.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Using the patient pointer (DFN) stored in the PATIENT NO. - DFN field (4) in the PROSTHETICS EXTRACT file (#727.826), ELIGIBILITY data is derived from the PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY CODE field (.361) in the PATIENT file (#2).  
                                PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY CODE is a pointer to the ELIGIBILITY CODE file (#8).  The data is derived from the MAS ELIGIBILITY CODE field (8) in the ELIGIBILITY CODE file (#8) which in turn is a pointer to the MAS ELIGIBILITY CODE
                                file (#8.1). 
                                 
                                The pointer value to file #8.1 is converted by ELIG^ECXUTL3 to the corresponding eligibility code used by NPCD.  This code is composed of two or three numeric characters.
