This file contains the data elements as specified by the Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office for the Prosthetics extract from existing VISTA files.  Entries into this file are made by extracting data that originates in the Prosthetics RECORD OF
PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR file (#660).  Information respective to the patient for which Prosthetic information is extracted is pulled from the PIMS Patient file (#2).  Once the extracts (making up the records in this file) are approved by the extract
manager, entries in this file are loaded into mail messages and transmitted to the commercial vendor.  This file is intended to be used for validation purposes only.  Entries in this file should be made only by the extract load routine.  
 
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.  However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference, the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT
NUMBER field (#2).  This cross reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be modified.  
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.

                                Using the combination of Feeder System, Feeder Location and Feeder Key as an identifier for each individual record matches are resolved and the designations are made.. If no match is found in file 727.6 an error message is
                                generated and a bulletin is triggered and sent to a DSS mail group identifying the problem.

                                Feeder Location and Feeder Key as an identifier for each individual record does the matches.  If no match is found an error message is generated and a bulletin is triggered and sent to a DSS mail group identifying the
