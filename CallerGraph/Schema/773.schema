                                When the MSH segment fields are successfully reset using either HLP("SUBSCRIBER") or HLP("SUBSCRIBER",#), the entire HLP("SUBSCRIBER") or HLP("SUBSCRIBER",#) array entry is stored on the ^HLMA(#,90) node.  There are eight
                                pieces in the HLP("SUBSCRIBER"[,#]) array, and there are eight fields on the ^HLMA(ien,90) node.  The eight pieces of HLP("SUBSCRIBER"[,#]) and the eight ^HLMA(ien,90) fields exactly correspond to each other.  
                                 
                                Note:  When ^HLMA(ien,90) is created, it is set equal to the entire 
                                       value of the HLP("SUBSCRIBER"[,#]) array entry.  The fields on 
                                       the ^HLMA(ien,90) node are not set separately!  (So, if the 
                                       application developer creates an invalid HLP("SUBSCRIBER"[,#]) 
                                       array, with invalid data stored in one or more of the eight 
                                       pieces, the ^HLMA(ien,90) node will similarly hold invalid 
                                       data.)
