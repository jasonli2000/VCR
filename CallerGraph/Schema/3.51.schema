This file holds the name of spool documents created by the Kernel spooler (%ZIS4) for all operating systems.  It does not hold the text of the documents themselves.  That text is first spooled to spool space, then moved into the ^XMB global as a mail
message.  This file does, however, provide the mechanism for securing spool space for and during spooling.  It is cross-referenced by name, spool number, user, and mail message.
