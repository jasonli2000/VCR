The APPLICATION ENTITY TITLE file (2006.588) is used to map Application Entity Titles to aliases and descriptive names.  It is built from the entries in AETITLE.DIC.  
 
The APPLICATION ENTITY TITLE file is used for two purposes.  When a DICOM Service Class User (SCU) negotiates an association with VistA, it may present a Called Application Entity Title that is different than one defined in the SCP_LIST.DIC.  The
APPLICATION ENTITY TITLE file may contain an entry for the SCU's Called Application Entity Title that maps it to one that is defined in SCP_LIST.DIC. This is required in order for the association to be accepted.  
 
The second purpose is to provide a mapping from the SCU's Calling Application Entity Title to a more descriptive name, which help to identify it better.  In this case, if the SCU's Called Application Entity Title is one that is defined in the
SCP_LIST.DIC, the entry in the APPLICATION ENTITY TITLE file is optional.

                                The AE_TITLE.DIC is used to map the Called Application Entity Title of a DICOM negotiation request to the alias that identifies the VistA Application Entity Title name for the SCP.  This is used for looking up acceptable 
                                presentation contexts in SCP_LIST.DIC.  The Called Application Entity Title for a DICOM request must either be the VistA Application Entity Title name in file SCP_LIST.DIC or else one defined in AE_Title.DIC as an alias
                                for the VistA one. Otherwise, the DICOM negotiation request will be rejected.
