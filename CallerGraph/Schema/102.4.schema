This file contains all acknowledgments for order results captured via the Care Management dashboards.  A stub is created here for the ordering provider when new results become available for an order that s/he placed; the entry is then updated when the
order is actually acknowledged via the CM application.  An order's results may also be acknowledged by other users as well, such as the nursing staff caring for the patient.
