   This file holds the rules that determine the conditions necessary 
 for a notification or some other action to be performed. Rules consist 
 of a set of Conditional Elements and a set of Element relationship 
 expressions. When an element is found to be TRUE for a patient, it 
 is compared to the other TRUE elements for the patient by evaluating 
 all the Element relation expressions that contain it. If an 
 expression is found to be TRUE then all of the actions defined for 
 that relation are performed.

                                   boolean variable names, and 'OR', 'AND', and 'NOT' for 
                                   boolean operators. You can also use any combination and 
                                   number of parenthesis to control the operator precedence, 
                                   Otherwise the precedence is from left to right.

                                      Operator is either + or -

                DESCRIPTION:       
                                    This field is used to define Mumps code that is executed after the expert system determines that a rule has been triggered, but before the Notification system is called.  
                                   
                                    This adds another level of flexibility to the expert system if a rule needs further processing to refine a recipient list or specialized checking to determine if the current notification should be sent, or if previous 
                                  duplicate notifications should be removed.  
                                   
                                    This field also provides a hook for other modes of notifying users of a triggered rule, if needed.
