This file is used to track the content and interactions with an alert.  Every alert which is generated is initially filed within this file.  Each entry has the date and time the alert was generated, which user generated the alert, whether the alert was
generated in a background task, what action was to be taken if any (the entry point or option name to be used) and the data string, if any, for use with the alert.  There is a multiple field which also identifies each user that the alert was sent to, and
when the user initially saw the displayed text, when the alert was selected for processing, when the processing was completed, and when the alert was deleted after processing or associated with another user's processing, or when the alert was deleted by
a clean-up operation.  
 
Unless a longer lifetime is specified for the specific alert, it will be deleted from the file after 30 days.  If a longer lifetime is specified, it will not be deleted until after that period passes.

                  DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to track how a specific recipient was selected for receiving the alert. The initial recipients are those to whom the alert was initially directed (INITIAL RECIPIENT).  Other recipients may be the 
                                    result of forwarding.  Recipients of the alert from forwarding are noted by the type of forwarding involved (FWD BY USER, EMAIL SURROGATE, CHIEF/SUPERVISOR, BACKUP REVIEWER, or LAST HOPE).  
                                     
                                    Marked as a specific category are those to whom the alert was directed, but who were not available to receive an alert due to lack of access (marked with the suffix "-UNDELIVERABLE" added to the basis for the alert
                                    being sent to the user).  
                                     
                                    Those who have alerts forwarded to their surrogate or receive the alert while acting as a surrogate for another user are indicated by entries in fields #.02 (SENT TO SURROGATE) and #.03 (ACTING AS SURROGATE), 
                                    respectively.  In addition, those who are acting as surrogates are identified in the current field by the suffix "-SURROGATE" added to the basis for the alert being received.  Since the recipient may be acting as 
                                    surrogate for more than one user, the actual users for which the message was sent on a surrogate basis are indicated in the SURROGATE FOR sub-file (#8992.113) under the RECIPIENT sub-file.  
                                     
                                    The values stored for this field are pointers to entries in the ALERT RECIPIENT TYPE file (#8992.2).
