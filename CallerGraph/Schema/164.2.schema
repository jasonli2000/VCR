Contains major site-groups for the Oncology package. It contains ALL the ACOS Site-Specific Surgery Codes. In addition, it also contains the SEER Extension and Lymph node coding - sharing that function with file 164.  
 
The "F" cross-reference of the TOPOGRAPHY Field (#.01) of the TOPOGRAPHY Multiple (#10) sets an index under ^ONCO(164.2,"F").  An index under ^ONCO(164.2,"G") is set by both the "G" cross-reference of the ICDO-1 TOPOGRAPHY Field (#.02) of the TOPOGRAPHY
Multiple (#10), and by the "AC" cross-reference of the TOPOGRAPHY Field (#.01) of the TOPOGRAPHY Multiple (#10) of the ICDO-1 SITE FOR ONCOLOGY File (#169.2).
