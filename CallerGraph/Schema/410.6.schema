This file contains all of the delivery schedules for items that the Control Point wishes to distribute on a request.  For each item of a request, they can distribute by date, quantity, Sub-Control Point and/or Delivery Point.  This file contains all
delivery schedules for each item of a request for a repetitive, non-repetitive or a non-repetitive/repetitive form type.  If the Sub-Control Point is entered, the dollar amount of the item's cost is calculated for that Sub-Control Point and all delivery
schedules' cost distribution to Sub-Control Points is totaled and the Sub-Control Point Multiple of the request is updated with the Sub-Control Point and its associated dollar amount.  If the distributed quantities and the request's transaction dollar 
amount matches, then entry into the Sub-Control Point Multiple is not required.  When the Control Point Official signs the request, this delivery schedule's Sub-Control Point dollar amount distribution updates the Sub-Control Point Balance.
