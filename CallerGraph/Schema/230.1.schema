This file contains a history of changes to key fields in the ED LOG file.  When a record is first created in the ED LOG file, and each time that record is updated, a record is also created in this file that contains the values of the fields that actually
changed.  This gives a thorough history of what was changed when and by whom.  A major purpose to the Emergency Department Tracking System is to measure how long it takes to do things.  By keeping this history file, with all the time stamps, it is
possible to generate a variety of reports.  These include information such as wait times, lengths of visit, number of delayed visits, etc.  
 
The fields in this file correspond to the identically named fields in the ED LOG file (230).  For more detail in the field description, please refer to the matching field in the ED LOG file.

      Short Descr:  Log History by time (LOG, TIME, IEN)
      Description:  This cross reference provides, for a single emergency department log record (entry in the ED LOG file) a forward chronological list of updates to the record.  
                     
                    The storage transform S X=+X ensures that numeric collation is used for all entries in the cross reference.  
        Set Logic:  S ^EDP(230.1,"ADF",X(1),X(2),DA)=""
       Kill Logic:  K ^EDP(230.1,"ADF",X(1),X(2),DA)
       Whole Kill:  K ^EDP(230.1,"ADF")
             X(1):  LOG ENTRY  (230.1,.01)  (Subscr 1)  (forwards)

  ADR (#869)    RECORD    REGULAR    IR    SORTING ONLY
      Short Descr:  Log History by inverse time (LOG, INVTIME, IEN)
      Description:  This cross reference provides, for a single emergency department log record (entry in the ED LOG file) a reverse chronological list of updates to the record.  
                     
                    Since the display board is refreshed frequently, this cross reference helps that happen as fast as possible.  It allows forward $O to be used to search back in time.  This is generally a faster operation than reverse $O on most M
                    systems.  
        Set Logic:  S ^EDP(230.1,"ADR",X(1),X(2),DA)=""
       Kill Logic:  K ^EDP(230.1,"ADR",X(1),X(2),DA)
       Whole Kill:  K ^EDP(230.1,"ADR")
             X(1):  LOG ENTRY  (230.1,.01)  (Subscr 1)  (forwards)
             X(2):  TIME  (230.1,.02)  (Subscr 2)  (forwards)
                      Transform (Storage):  S X=9999999-X

  C (#870)    RECORD    REGULAR    IR    LOOKUP & SORTING
      Short Descr:  Indexes changes for a log entry by inverse time.
        Set Logic:  S ^EDP(230.1,"C",X(1),X(2),DA)=""
       Kill Logic:  K ^EDP(230.1,"C",X(1),X(2),DA)
       Whole Kill:  K ^EDP(230.1,"C")
