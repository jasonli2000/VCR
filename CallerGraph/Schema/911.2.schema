The ESP DISPOSITION CODES file contains a series of descriptive codes which will assist the VA Police in tracking how they resolve or make disposition of recorded offenses and issued violation notices.  Some disposition codes apply only to offense
dispositions and others only to the disposition of violation notices.  These codes are screened so they can be selected only for the appropriate type of disposition.
