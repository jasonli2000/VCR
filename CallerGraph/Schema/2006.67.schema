This file allows us to map a given Radiology procedure to other procedures of interest based on grouping of CPT codes, or attributes associated with the CPT code (Modality, Body Part).  This supports logic in the hanging protocols for automatically 
retrieving and displaying prior exams of interest when interpreting a new exam for a patient.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains generic body region descriptive information derived from the AMA CPT book.  The values used are from the Radiology procedures section; it provides a general frame of reference when assigning Body Part
                                asociations.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field points to another CPT entry in this file.  It is used to identify another procedure that is "similar" to this one for automatic prior exams matching.  As many CPTs as desired may point to the same MATCH GROUP
                                CPT value--this will have the effect where any one of those procedures are thus part of the same group of exams for matching.  I.e., looking for matching priors for any one of those values would be able to retrieve exams
                                that correspond to all of the CPTs so defined.

              DESCRIPTION:      Searching for prior exams may be done by matching the Body Part(s) of the current exam with prior exams of the same Body Part as defined in this file.  Note that prior exams matching logic may use Body Part in combination 
                                with Modality to find matching CPT codes.

                                  code.  Note that prior exams matching logic may use Body Part in combination with Modality to find matching CPT codes.

                                  code.  Note that prior exams matching logic may use Modality in combination with Body Part to find matching CPT codes.
