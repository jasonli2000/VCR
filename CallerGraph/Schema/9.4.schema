This file identifies the elements of a package that will be transported by the initialization routines created by DIFROM.  The prefix determines which namespaced entries will be retrieved from the Option, Bulletin, Help Frame, Function, and Security Key
Files as well as the namespace that will be used to name the INIT routines built by running DIFROM.  The Excluded Namespace field may be used to leave out some of these items.  The File Multiple determines which files are sent with the package and 
whether data is included.  Print, Input, Sort and Screen (FORM) templates are brought in by namespace, for the files listed in the File multiple.  In addition, there are multiples for each type of template, that allow the user to specify individual
templates outside the namespace to retrieve.  Routines to be run before and after the INIT are specified in the Environment Check Routine, Pre-init after User Commit, and Post-Initialization Routine fields. The remaining fields are simply for
documentation.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                  A call to this routine gets inserted, by DIFROM at the beginning of the NAMESPACE_INIT routine, before the EN entry point.
