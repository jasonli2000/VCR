The system manager can input partial or full matches to network addresses into this file.  When Network mail receives a message from a sender that contains the string input, that message will be rejected.  This file can be used to prevent spam or
nuisance messages from being received from a remote site.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains a list of senders from whom messages will be rejected.  The test is that the sender's name contains the string in one of these fields.  A site could therefore choose to reject all messages that come 
                                from a particular domain, from a person at a domain or from any domain that is a subdomain of a domain.  This is not a complete list, but is a set of examples of what could be done.  
                                 
                                Rejection is done during the processing of the MAIL FROM: message protocol data unit.
