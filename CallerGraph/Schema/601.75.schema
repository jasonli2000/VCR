This file contains the individual selections possible in a multiple choice question.  Examples are Yes or No, True or False, 1.  Abraham Lincoln, 2. George Washington, 3. George W. Bush or 4. Richard Nixon. For instruments first defined in the legacy
system MH INSTRUMENT file (#601), a single character is specified for a multiple choice answer.  If George Washington was the choice selected the legacy value would be 2.  
 
Choices are pointed to by the MH CHOICETYPES file (#601.751) which is a collection of choices.  Choices are referenced in the MH ANSWERS file (#601.85) as a pointer to the full response.
