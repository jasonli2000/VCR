For a hospital registry, Class of Case divides cases into two groups. 
 
Analytic cases (codes 00-22) are those that are required by CoC (Commission on Cancer) to be abstracted because of the program's primary responsibility in managing the cancer. Analytic cases are grouped according to the location of diagnosis and
treatment. Treatment and outcome reports may be limited to analytic cases.  
 
Nonanalytic cases (codes 30-49 and 99) may be abstracted by the facility to meet central registry requirements or because of a request by the facility's cancer program.
