              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 1 to make the immunization type inactive. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to inactivate an immunization type.  If this field contains a "1" then the immunization is inactive.  Inactive immunizations cannot be selected in the manual data entry process. Immunization entries 
                                should be made inactive when they are no longer used. Do not delete the entry or change the meaning of the immunization entry.  
                                 
                                To make an inactive immunization active, enter the "@" symbol to delete the "1" from the field.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field was added for use by PCE in the VA.  
                                 
                                The inactive flag should be used, rather than deleting entries in the immunization file, since there may be other files pointing at the immunization entry.
