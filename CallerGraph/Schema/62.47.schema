Used to map standard code system concepts to the related area of the Laboratory package database. It supports mapping codes used in the role identifying the result or expressing the answer.  
 
Examples of result codes are LOINC and VA NLT Test Result codes such as LOINC code 11475-1 MICROORGANISM IDENTIFIED: PRID:PT:XXX:NOM:CULTURE which represents the concept of organism identified.  
 
Examples of answer codes are SNOMED CT code 23506009 which is the term 'normal flora' or SNOMED CT code 30334005 AEROMONAS SALMONICIDA (ORGANISM) which represents the name of the organism identified.  
 
This file should not export its data via the standard KIDS data export mechanism.  Because local codes can have the same identifier as national codes, the KIDS install may inadvertently overwrite local codes.  Data exports should use a different
mechanism, such as using KIDS Transport global to load the data onto the target system.
