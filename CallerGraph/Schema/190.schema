              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-45 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is to be used by VA consolidated sites ONLY.  It will be set as part of the consolidation process and must not be altered in any way.  
                                 
                                The purpose of this field is to allow consolidated sites to continue to use existing barcoded labels on their records rather than having to relabel all records.  It will store the value of the record label's barcode.  A
                                cross-reference has been added to allow the look-up to select the appropriate record.  This will only be used for records created prior to the consolidation.  
                                 
                                This field will contain the barcode information EXCEPT for the check-digit.  
                                 
                                For sites not involved in a consolidation, this field will contain no data and look-up will be unaffected.

                                2)= K ^RT("AOLDBC",$E(X,1,30),DA)
                                This cross-reference is used only for consolidated sites.  If a record was created at a VAMC which has had its database consolidated, this cross-reference will contain the old barcode information.  The look-up process will
                                use this cross-reference to find the proper IEN of the RECORDS file.
