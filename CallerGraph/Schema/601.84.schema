The MH ADMINISTRATIONS file (#601.84) contains the data collected during the administration of a specified instrument from the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file (#601.71) given to a patient at a specific date and time. For each administration of a specified
instrument from the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file (#601.71) there will be an entry in this file. 
 
An entry in this file does not store the results of the instrument's administration but is an index to the instrument's administration. The entry indicates whether the instrument has been completed, who ordered the instrument, how many questions were
answered and if the test has been electronically signed.
