This file defines the resolution statuses that may be related to a finding.  National resolution statuses are distributed in this file, but sites may create local resolution statuses.  If local resolutions are defined, they must be mapped to a national
resolution status.  The national resolution statuses are used by the process that creates dialog sentences for finding items.  
 
The distributed national resolution statuses may not be deleted. 
 
Most of the findings from files can be automatically analyzed and associated with a resolution status.  For example, Education topics entered for a current visit are "DONE AT ENCOUNTER", Education topics entered for a historical visit are "DONE
ELSEWHERE", Education topics with a Level of Understanding of Refused are "PATIENT REFUSED" resolutions. The health factor is a file of findings that we cannot categorize without the sites telling us what the related resolution status should be.  
 
The statuses will be used in the future for roll-up counts to reflect how reminders were resolved (done, historical, refused, contraindicated, ordered).

              DESCRIPTION:      This is a name that can be used to group reminder resolutions.  Local resolution status names need to be mapped to a national resolution status.  The Health Factor findings are the findings that may be mapped to the 
                                resolution statuses.

                  Description:  When a local status is deleted the ACP cross reference is used to remove the local status from the sub-status multiple on the related national status. To determine the national status to which the local status belongs the
                                AC index is used.
