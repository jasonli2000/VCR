This file is used to define and described a relationship between two facilities, a collecting facility and a host facility, for the collecting, processing, receipting and reporting of laboratory testing of clinical specimens. It is used to control the
building of shipping manifests which are used as shipping documents for the transport of clinical specimens between the facilities which make up the configuration. It controls how the specimens are processed at both facilities and the means and methods
used to communicate test orders and results for these two entities.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to link a shipping configuration with an electronic transmission of shipping manifests. When a shipping manifest is shipped, this field is checked to determine if the software should transmit the orders 
                                on the manifest to the host facility. It identifies the entry in the LA7 MESSAGE PARAMETER file #62.8 to use for building and transmitting the manifest.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Should site/patient/specimen information be barcoded on shipping manifest. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field determines if site/patient/specimen information is barcoded on the shipping manifest when it has a status of "shipped".  
                                 
                                There are two styles of bar codes. The regular style (code="YES"), which was released with the original version of Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI), produces a long bar code. If the receiving site, which is
                                reading these type of bar codes, has problems then switch to the compact style (code="YES-COMPACT"). This will produce a shorter bar code.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Should a receipt print with shipping manifest for courier to sign. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Allows site to have a receipt printed with a shipping manifest when the status of the manifest is "SHIPPED". This receipt can be used to record acknowledgment of receipt of the shipment by the courier service used to 
                                transport the specimens to the host facility.

              DESCRIPTION:      If orders are being sent to a non-VA facility and the facility can not accept VA test order codes then answer with the type of coding system. "NON-VA" indicates that the other system is using a local coding system. The
                                laboratory shipping software will then use the non-VA test codes entered for each test on this configuration.

                                VA test order codes are usually NLT codes but in the future may be LOINC codes. Selecting "LOINC" is currently not supported.  Support will be added in a future version of the LEDI software when LOINC coding has been
                                implemented within VA facilities.
