                HELP-PROMPT:      Identify INSTITUTION associated with this address. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This pointer field replaces the function of the RX PRINT ADDRESS, LAB ORDER PRINT ADDRESS, and RADIOLOGY PRINT ADDRESS fields (21612.01 to 21612.03) in the INSTITUTION file.  These fields will be removed.  Instead of
                                  computing the VFD ADDRESS to which an INSTITUTION points, the supporting API will compute the ADDRESS from an index of INSTITUTIONS in the VFD ADDRESS file.

                HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate the institution's usage of this address entry. 
                DESCRIPTION:      As indicated, this multiple replaces the function of three fields in the INSTITUTION file, 21612.01 - 21612.03.  The ASSOCIATED USAGE field links the INSTITUTION pointer (sub-field #.01) to a particular usage of the
                                  address entry, in the same way that each pointer from INSTITUTION linked to an address entry for a particular usage, implied by the field name (e.g. #21612.01 -> RX PRINT ADDRESS).
