The PATIENT file contains all the patients followed by the medical center/ Outpatient clinic.  At a minimum each patient entry must have a NAME, DATE OF BIRTH and SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.  In order to add a new patient to the PATIENT file the user must
also indicate whether or not the patient is requesting to receive care as a VETERAN of the U.S. Armed Forces and specify the TYPE of patient being added to the system.  For the most part the information contained in this file is demographic in nature, 
i.e., address, employment, service history, etc., however data concerning admissions, appointments,etc., is also stored in this file.  The ADMISSION sub-field is scheduled to be moved into the new PATIENT MOVEMENT file by the end of calendar year 1989. 
Care should be used when removing a patient from the PATIENT file since virtually all other DHCP modules do utilize data from this file.  Of the many fields in the file you will note that many are preceeded by an asterisk.  Those fields are scheduled to
be removed from the file due to either lack of use or replacement by another field/file in the next release.

              DESCRIPTION:      The Bad Address Indicator field applies to the address at which the patient resides.  This field should be set as follows (if applicable): 
                                 
                                    "UNDELIVERABLE" - Bad Address based on returned mail.  
                                    "HOMELESS" - Patient is known to be homeless.  
                                    "OTHER" - Other Bad Address Reason 
                                 
                                Setting this field will prevent a Bad Address from being shared with HEC and other VAMC facilities. It will also be used to block Means Test Renewal Letters from being sent.  
                                 
                                Once the Bad Address Indicator is set, incoming "newer" addresses will automatically remove the Bad Address Indicator, and allow the "updated" address to be transmitted to HEC and other VAMC facilities.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is being used in conjunction with Patient Address fields .111, .1112, .112, .113, .114, .115, .116, and .117, which are located in the Patient (#2) file.  
                                 
                                A programmer API, $$BADADR^DGUTL3(DFN) will allow the return of the Bad Address Indicator.  The following parameters are used: 
                                 
                                Input Parameter: DFN - internal entry number for the Patient file (#2) 
                                   Return value: internal value of the Bad Address Indicator or <null>

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field contains an input transform which does a number of things.  It validates the date entered, does not allow a date prior to the current date, and prevents changes to this field if the Confidential Address is 
                                flagged INACTIVE.  
                                 
                                Special note: the input transform sets %DT(0)=DT to validate the date entered.  Because changes to this field will update the CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS CHANGE DT/TM field, it is necessary to kill %DT(0) after the validation. 
                                This variable, if valued, can prevent EVENT^IVMPLOG from setting the transmit flag if only the Start and End dates are changed.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Choose from the available listing the PATIENT TYPE which best classifies this patient. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter the patient type for this patient.  This is selectable from the distributed entries in the TYPE OF PATIENT file.  The type selected should be the primary one selectable.  For example, if the patient is both an NSC
                                veteran and an employee, the patient type should be NSC VETERAN, not employee.  
                                 
                                This field is used by the registration screen processor to determine which screens will be editable for this patient.  The selection of which screens can be viewed for which types of patients can be made through the
                                'Patient Type Update' option.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The type of patient is used to determine which screens in the registration process should be allowed for entry/edit.  The 'Patient Type Update' option in MAS can be used to determine which screens are editable for each

                                This cross reference is used to remember that changes were made to the PATIENT file (#2) outside of the Registration process.  Execution of this cross reference will create an entry in the ADT/HL7 PIVOT file (#391.71) and
                                mark it as requiring transmission of an HL7 ADT-A08 message.
