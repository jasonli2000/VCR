              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the information that makes up the event code screen.

                                Category is optionally used within each DSS Unit to group procedures. When utilized, category is a pointer to the EVENT CAPTURE CATEGORY file (#726). Otherwise it is a zero (0).  When category is not used and stored as a
                                zero (0), it is shown with the name "None" on all display screens and reports.  
                                 
                                Procedure is a variable pointer to A. CPT file (#81) or B. EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file (#725).
