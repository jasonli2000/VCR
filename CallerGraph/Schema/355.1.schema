      Short Descr:  Effective Date Index
      Description:  This index is used to find the part A and B percentages paid for a type of plan based on the group and reason codes entered on the MRA.  This index uses computed code: X(3):  Computed Code: S X=$P($G(^IBE(355.1,DA(3),14,DA(2),0)),U) 
                    which sets X(3) = to the external value of the Group Code and X(4):  Computed Code: S X=$P($G(^IBE(355.1,DA(3),14,DA(2),1,DA(1),0)),U) which sets X(4) = to the external value of the Reason Code.  This allows for an efficient match
                    between the Group and Reason Codes on the patient's MRA and the Group and Reason Codes for the patient's supplemental type of plan.
