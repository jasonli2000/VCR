This file provides a mechanism for sites to tailor the running of package extracts by defining the frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly) with which the extracts will run and the number of days in the past for which data will be extracted.  The EXTRACT
NAME field (#.01) and the FILE NUMBER field (#1) are national standard entries, exported with the file, and should not be edited locally.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The AF cross reference on this file is used by the extract routines, using the variable ECFILE, to determine the frequency with which the extract is run and, from the frequency, the starting and ending days for the
                                extract.

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 25, 1994 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field determines the frequency with which this extract will be run.  Daily extracts are run for a single day, T-X, where X is the number entered in the DAYS AGO field in this file.  Weekly extracts are run for the
                                week ending on T-X.  Monthly extracts are run for the previous month.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                This field is used by the extract routines to determine the starting and ending dates for the extract.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is used for daily and weekly extracts to determine how many days ago the extract should look for data.  For daily extracts, the date would be T-X, for weekly extracts, the date range would be from T-X-7 to T-X.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                Used by the extract routines to determine the date for a daily extract or the date range for a weekly extract.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                The name of the routine which performs this extract.  Data is loaded into this field at creation time as should not be edited in the field 

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Data in this field is used to queue the initial extract.  Once the extract manager specifies the frequency, days offset, start date (which is not a data element in this file), the extract setup calls %ZTLOAD to queue
                                QUE^routine at the proper time.

              HELP-PROMPT:      The offset, in days, for the daily local extract 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is used by the local daily extract to determine how many days back to look for data

              LAST EDITED:      MAR 24, 1994 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is set by the software when the extract is queued to run.  Once this field is set, other data elements should be changed only with extreme care.  Changing either the frequency or the days ago field could result
                                in a date range being missed and not extracted for trasmission to TSI.

                                This is the print name for the extract.  It has an important use in supplying a data element to the TYPE field (#2) of the DSS EXTRACT LOG file (#727).  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  A free text field; only 1st character is capitalized.  Used as print name for the extract.  
                                 
                                This data element is also hard-coded into the SETUP code unit of each extract routine using variable ECPACK.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  A 3-character identifying code; each character is an uppercase alpha.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This numeric provides the position of the data element which indicates whether an extract of this type is currently running or is queued to run.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                The piece of the ^ECX(728,1,7.1) node indicated in this field will contain an "R", if the extract is currently running or queued to run.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 2 and 500, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This number is the maximum number of lines per transmission message allowed for this extract type.  
                                  
                                A default value of 200 is usually acceptable for most extracts.  However, for some (e.g., CLI, ADM) lower values are recommended.  
                                 
                                It may be possible in some cases to set a value greater than 200, thus reducing the total number of transmission messages needed for the extract.  However, if the transmission message becomes larger than 32 Kbytes, it will
                                be rejected by AAC.
