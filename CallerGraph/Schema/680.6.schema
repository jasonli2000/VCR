                                option.  This field points to the station's vendor file;  therefore values to be used here must already be in the vendor file.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field allows for the input of the local facility name or identifying code or number for the separately ported printer which will be used to generate the routing slips at the time of check-in.  If no printer is
                                assigned here, then routing slips will print to the screen and will have to be captured to a slaved printer.  This will slow down the check-in process considerably.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is to allow input of a division name in the case of two-division facilities.  While the field is present in the current version of the Serials Module, it does not activate any features to allow two different
                                divisions operating from the same DHCP system to use the local Serials Module in a differential manner.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is a set of codes to enable automatic queueing of the routing slips during the check-in process to the ROUTING SLIP PRINTER identified above.  This question must be answered yes and a ROUTING SLIP PRINTER
                                identified to generate routing slips automatically.  Otherwise, routing slips will print to the screen and must be captured to a slaved printer.
