This file describes the volume sets available in the current multiprocessor network.  The information pertaining to each volume set is primarily used by the Kernel, especially TaskMan.  The ucis that make up each volume set can be determined by using the
cross-references in the UCI Association Table file.

              LAST EDITED:      NOV 21, 1994 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field describes how TaskMan should treat the volume set.  It takes over many of the 486 configuration functions handled by the Out of Order and Replacement Volume Set fields in versions 6.5 and 7.0.  
                                 
                                General Purpose Volume Set:  The Manager on a G type will usually send tasks back to the volume set where they were created, except that tasks that explicitly request a different volume set will be sent where they ask. 
                                (Explicit volume set requests are made by using 1) the ZTCPU input variable to the %ZTLOAD entry point, 2) the CPU (VOL SET) field of the Device file, or 3) the Queued to What Volume Set field of the Option file.)  To
                                transfer tasks TO a G type, TaskMan will use extended global references to copy the task to the destination Task and Schedule files, and will then remove the task from this side.  
                                 
                                Print Server:  On a P type, the Manager will run any task it finds unless the task explicitly requests a different volume set.  Tasks are transferred TO a P type the same as to a G type, and Submanagers behave the same.  
                                 
                                Compute Server:  Tasks are transferred to a C type by placing the tasks in the Link Waiting List and jobbing a Submanager across to that volume set.  Submanagers started on a C type will only process tasks in the Link 
                                Waiting List for their volume set.  
                                 
                                File Server and Other Non-TaskMan Volume Set: Tasks sent from or to a F or O type will be rejected.  
                                 
                                Because of the field's crucial role in guiding TaskMan's behavior, the field is required.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is used by the Manager and Submanager as described above.  It is also used by the Global Support Routines to decide which volume sets are likely to have ^%ZTSCH("UPDATE") nodes that need to be killed to get the
                                Manager to update its parameters.

                                Tasks that request a volume set without link access are rejected by TaskMan.  Such volume sets are usually PC workstations linked into the larger network.  They can access the core computers, but cannot be accessed

                                While a volume set is out of service, tasks that would normally be sent across the local links to that volume set are either saved until the volume set is back in service, or sent to a replacement volume set if one is

                                If a volume set serves the files that the rest of the system needs, it should be a required volume set.  So long as a volume set is required, the normal mechanisms of handling links that are out of service or dropped are 
                                bypassed for that volume set.  Instead, TaskMan waits until the link is restored before processing any more tasks.

                                A replacement volume set should be essentially equivalent in features to the current one, since tasks that would normally run on this one will be running on that one instead.  For many volume sets, no other volume set is 
                                equivalent, and tasks should wait for the link to be restored rather than run elsewhere.
