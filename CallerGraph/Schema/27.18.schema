This file contains reasons for the awarding of and changes to pension benefits. The VBA manages benefits awards and changes to benefits.  Receiving VA Pension is a monetary benefit granted to a Veteran. Recently, additional information has been shared
with the HEC so that periods of award could be more accurately shown for billing purposes. Simply having a Pension Indicator = yes or no is not enough for that purpose. 
 
This file comes pre-populated and the sites are not allowed to edit it. Any changes to file will come in a patch.
