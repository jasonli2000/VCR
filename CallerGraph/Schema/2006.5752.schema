The IMPORTABLE DICOM OBJECTS file (#2006.5752) is on the VistA HIS and tracks the importable DICOM objects that are on each of the different the DICOM Gateways.  
 
This allows the site to see all importable DICOM objects from each of the site's DICOM Gateways. 
 
The information is obtained from DICOM Gateway's file DICOM OBJECTS TO BE IMPORTED (#2006.5751).  Information is periodically updated by a remote procedure call on the DICOM Gateways connecting to VistA.
