This file is used as a repository of ICD search (lookup) functionality to support an application's need for different user interface calls across multiple versions of ICD Diagnosis and Procedure coding.  
 
Each entry is associated with a specific version of ICD Diagnosis or Procedure coding, an application, and executable M code.  The executable M code can be invoked from within the input transform of a field that points to the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (80) or
the ICD OPERATION/ PROCEDURE file (80.1) to achieve the correct search functionality specific to the ICD version.  
 
This file was developed during the ICD-10 Remediation project with the intent that it will support ICD-11 and beyond.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the name of the application that this API will be used by.  Answer must be 3-30 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This is the name of the application that this API will be used by.  A package may have more than one application name if it is required.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field will be used by applications to enter a name.  Some applications may need more than one name, for example in ADT an entry might be created for PTF and another for RUG if they needed different API calls.  
                                 
                                The value in this field will be used in the API to retrieve the correct entry.  For example, in Surgery, this field might contain SURG.  The input transform for a top level field might read D

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The value stored in the Database (either DIAG or PROC) is used in calls to retrieve the correct API.  For example, in the Surgery file the input transform would be 'D GETAPI^SROICDGT("SURG","DIAG",DA) for a top level
                                field.
