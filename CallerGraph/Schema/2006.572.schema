This file contains information about studies for which all images have been transmitted to a VistA DICOM Gateway.  
 
When all images for a study have been transmitted, the study (or examination, or briefly, 'exam') is called 'complete'.  
 
The information that is collected for each study consists of a flag that indicated whether or not the exam is complete, an accession number, a patient ID as well as the patient's name, and an unique identifier for the study (UID).
