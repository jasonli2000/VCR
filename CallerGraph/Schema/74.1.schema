This file contains the standard report text that the interpreting physician can choose from when dictating a report.  The transcriptionist is usually the person who copies the standard report into the appropriate exam's report record while using the
'Report Enter/Edit' function.  
 
The transcriptionist will only be given the 'Select STANDARD REPORTS' prompt during the 'Report Enter/Edit' function if the 'division' parameter controlling standard reports use is set to 'yes'.  
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
The data for the 'STANDARD REPORTS' file is stored in the ^RA(74.1, global. At the present time this file is very static after day-one initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.  It should also be translated if the operating
system supports this function.
