              DESCRIPTION:      In recoding diets, this is the order in which the clinical 'default production diets' will be matched against this production diet. Recoding will occur as soon as a match occurs. Therefore, this field can be conceptualized
                                as representing the relative importance of the production diet.

              LAST EDITED:      OCT 06, 1989 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field, when answered YES, indicates that this production diet is a combination of other production diets (e.g., both low sodium and calorie restricted). Since ALL production diets in a combo must match the 'default
                                production diets' of a clinical order, such combo production diets should have a tally order less than any of the individual production diets contained in the combo.
