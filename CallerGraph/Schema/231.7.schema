This file contains staff assigned to a particular area (e.g., the emergency department).  It allows for concise selection lists when updating the tracking log.  It also allows for particular colors to be associated with staff.  When that person is shown
on the display board, the colors may be used to more easily tell who is assigned to which patient.

      Description:  This cross reference supports constructing a list of currently active staff for a particular role.  
                     
                    For this record level cross reference, the kill logic should always be executed when any value changes.  The set logic is then executed conditionally, allowing the cross reference to hold only active values.

      Short Descr:  SITE,AREA,DUZ,IEN
      Description:  This cross reference allows searching the file for an entry matching a particular DUZ (say, to look up a color map).  Since a person may work as staff in multiple areas, this cross reference allows finding the staff record that
                    applies to the person's activity in a specific area.
