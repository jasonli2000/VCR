This file acts as the entry point into storage. It holds information about a particular type of artifact (i.e. medical image in DICOM format), and maps this type of document to its intrinsic retention policy. It also stores the file extension to be used
for files of the given type.  
 
Artifact descriptor records will be inserted during patch installation time, and are not available for creation or deletion by users. In the first release, we plan to make them not modifiable as well. In future releases, we will probably add the ability
to change the intrinsic retention policy for the given artifact descriptor.
