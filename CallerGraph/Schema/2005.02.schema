This file contains an entry for every type of object handled by the VistA Imaging System. It is exported with data. All sites must have entries for the data types distributed in order to display objects sent via multimedia mail.  
 The Object Type file handles objects of various types.  These include: 
  * still images 
  * image groups 
  * graphics or waveforms 
  * scanned documents 
  * audio files  
 
 Other types are expected in the future (i.e., image overlays, motion video chips, and office automation files).  An object, such as an image series, may actually consist of multiple objects.  In this case, the object type is Group.  The Object Group
multiple field is used to point to a set of objects in the Image file.  Each object type has associated methods (software routines) for performing certain actions.  For example, there are methods for displaying images and image abstracts.  The group type
is used to combine multiple objects of the same or different types to create complex objects.  
 
 There are different image types, for example: 
  * black and white high-resolution x-rays 
  * black and white ultrasound images (lower resolution) 
  * pseudo-color nuclear medicine scans 
  * medium resolution true color bronchoscopy images 
  * pathology images 
 
 Each type of object has a number of specific characteristics, including the methods  required to display them.  For example, each object type has a type name and an associated display method or window.  
 
 All accesses to objects use the file finder routine ^MAGFILE or ^MAGFILEA to find the network location needed.  Different entry points of this routine will find locations of full files, abstract files, and jukebox copies of files.  In addition, the 
network write location will be returned for image captures.
