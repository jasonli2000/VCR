              LAST EDITED:      JAN 16, 2001 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates whether a stock location is active (A) or inactive (I).  Stock locations should not be deleted once they have participated in inventory transactions because other inventory files will inevitably point 
                                to the Stock Location file. Instead stock locations should be marked as inactive when no longer in use (due to stock room re-organisation or any other reason).  The system will not allow receipts into inactive locations,
                                but issues and outward transfers will be permitted (although ideally all stock should be transferred to other active locations before deactivation).
