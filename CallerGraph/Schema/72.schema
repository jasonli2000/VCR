This file contains the statuses an imaging exam may be in, as it is processed.  
 
The fields in this file generally fall into three basic categories: 
 
          o fields that indicate what data has to be entered for an 
            exam in order for the exam to be placed in the status.  
 
          o when using the 'Exam Status Tracking' system, which prompts 
            should be asked of the user when trying to move an exam 
            into the status.  
 
          o fields that indicate to the various workload report 
            routines whether an exam in a particular exam status 
            should be used in the compilation of the report 
 
When the system is initialized, the following statuses and their 'order' in the exam process are loaded into this file: 
 
         Order            Status 
         -----            ------
          1               WAITING FOR EXAM 
          2               CALLED FOR EXAM 
          3               EXAMINED 
          4               TRANSCRIBED 
          9               COMPLETE 
          0               CANCELLED 
 
The site does not have to use this configuration.  The only requirements of the system are the following: 
 
          o there must be a status with an order of '1'; this is the 
            status that the module will place an exam in upon registration.  
 
          o there must be a status with an order of '9'; when an exam 
            reaches this status then the module considers the exam 
            complete and the exam can no longer be called up by case 
            number; also the case number can then be reused.  
 
          o there must be a status with an order of '0' and it must 
            be called 'CANCELLED'.  
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
The data for the EXAMINATION STATUS' file is stored in the ^RA(72, global. At the present time this file is very static after day-one initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.  It should also be translated if the operating
system supports this function.
