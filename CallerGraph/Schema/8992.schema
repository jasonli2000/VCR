This file is used to keep track of alerts pending processing for each user.  The main entry for each record is a pointer to the NEW PERSON file.  
 A multiple under each user is used to record the date and time an alert was generated, the unique ID associated with the alert, the text for display, and an optional routine entry point or option for use in processing the alert, and an optional data
string associated with the alert.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field may contain a pointer to the NEW PERSON file who has been designated as a SURROGATE recipient.  That individual will receive alerts designated for the current user during the period of time specified by the 
                                entries in SURROGATE START DATE/TIME field [#.03] and the SURROGATE END DATE/TIME field [#.04] or, if one or both of those fields is not specified, until the SURROGATE entry is removed.  If the SURROGATE END DATE/TIME
                                field [#.04] is populated, the SURROGATE data will be removed automatically the first time an alert is sent to the current USER after the specified date and time.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field may contain a date and time which will specify when forwarding of alerts to the SURROGATE specified in field #.02 will begin.  If there is no entry in this field, and field #.02 is populated, alerts will be sent

              DESCRIPTION:      This field may contain a date and time.  If data is present, it indicates the time at which sending of alerts to the individual specified in the SURROGATE field (#.02) should be terminated.  If no data is present, and the
                                SURROGATE field is populated, then alerts will be sent to the SURROGATE until that entry is removed.

                DESCRIPTION:      This is a field in which the package id passed during alert filing.  This id may simply be a package namespace, or it may be a namespace followed by additional data to more accurately identify the type or purpose of the 
                                  alert.

                                  value may not be known, e.g., an application which was selected by the user without selecting the ALERT ACTION option to process the alert.

                HELP-PROMPT:      This flag is set when the alert has not been displayed to the user previously. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This flag is used by the alert processing to indicate a new alert which has not previously been presented to the user.  After the alert message text has been shown to the user, this flag is cleared and the user must then
                                  select the VIEW ALERTS option to process the alert.

                                  This flag is optional at the present time, since the need for action processing can be determined by the presence of an option name or a routine name for use during alert processing.

                DESCRIPTION:      While named ENTRY POINT, this is a dual function field.  If the next field (#.08, AROUTINE NAME) contains a routine name, this field contains the desired entry point within that routine (this field may also be null, 
                                  indicating that the entry point should be at the top of the routine).  If field #.08 is null, then the contents of this field is interpreted as the name of an option which is to be entered when the alert is processed.

                DESCRIPTION:      If this field is not null, it contains the name of a routine which is to be used when the alert is processed.  If there is also a value in field #.07, that value is used as an entry point into the routine specified in 
                                  this field.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field was added as a flag to identify alerts which the packages indicate may be deleted by the user without processing the alert.  The value is optional and is passed by the package which generates the alert if they
                                  want to give permission for users to be able to delete the alert.  The flag is checked in the code handling user deletion of alerts.  If an alert involves an action (via an option or routine) it may not be deleted by the
                                  user unless this flag is set.

                DESCRIPTION:      The 'DAYS FOR BACKUP REVIEWER' field contains a number of days, which if exceeded without the alert being processed will cause the alert to be forwarded to the designated 'XQAL BACKUP REVIEWER' in the PARAMETER file with
                                  a comment indicating that the alert had not been reviewed by the original recipient.

                                  alert without requiring interaction or provision of information by the user.  In this way information related to patient entry number, specific internal numbers for the desired data, etc may be stored and returned.

                                  This field is a pointer value to the PATIENT file, if the alert is patient related.  It is not a required field for non-patient related alerts.
