                LAST EDITED:      NOV 26, 1990 
                DESCRIPTION:      The balance flag is not currently being utilized in calulating the figures for the AMIS reports.  The balance flag, however is to insure that the AMIS figures 'balance' at the End Of Month.  For example, The 'Patients
                                  Remaining EOM' from the prior month's AMIS report, plus all new admissions/gains, subtract all discharges/losses should equal the 'Patients Remaining EOM' on the current AMIS report.  

                TECHNICAL DESCR:  The balance flag is set when the AMIS report is in or out of balance.  For instance, the figure in field "Patients Remaining End Of Month" from the previous month's report + all current admissions/gains - all current
                                  discharges/losses = current month's "Patients Remaining End Of Month".  This field is a set of codes where '1' represents 'Segment In Balance' and '0' indicates 'Segment Out of Balance'.
