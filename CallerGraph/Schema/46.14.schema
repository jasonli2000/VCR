In the initial design of the RAI/MDS interface, the need to create a discharge when a patient exceeds 30 days in ASIH was overlooked.  Because the RAI/MDS interface is triggered by PIMS ADT events, there is no PIMS event for this discharge.  In fact, the
PIMS software creates a pseudo discharge at the time the patient goes on ASIH with a date/time of NOW plus 30 days.  Therefore, if the 30 days is exceeded, the discharge goes into affect.  If the patient returns or dies while ASIH, the discharge is 
either deleted or modified.  In order to maintain control of the patients on ASIH, a new file was created.  In addition, a routine which will periodically run checking the entries for patients who have exceeded the 30 day stay.  Whenever a stay is found
to exceed the 30 days, an HL7 Discharge (A03) will be created and sent to the COTS system and the entry in the RAI MDS ASIH PATIENT file will be inactivated.  This file and associated routine and option are part of patch DG*5.3*328.
