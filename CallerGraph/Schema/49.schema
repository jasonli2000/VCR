This file is a list of the services and sections within the services.  Some of the entries may be 'MIS COSTING SECTIONS' for use with the cost accounting part of the Management Information System software.  A section is an MIS section if there is a code
entered in the field called MIS COSTING CODE.  In the cost accounting system all medical center costs will be tied to a particular section.  When MIS sections change, do not delete the old section.  Instead, change the fields under the multiple field
called "DATE CLOSED" to identify which sections are no longer in use.
