 Synonyms are single terms that can be associated with one or more TERMS in the lookup file (tokens in the MTLU cross-reference). For example, CANCER can be associated with each of the specific forms of cancer that might be found. Note that if the user
enters a phrase, all terms in the phrase must be true to get a match, therefore 'LUNG CANCER' might significantly restrict the search.
