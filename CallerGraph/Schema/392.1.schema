              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the one way mileage (in whole numbers between 0 and 10000) distance (e.g. between place of departure and place of destination).  The default mileage is between the departure city and the primary
                                division of the instituion.  This value is not accessed directly by the user but is stuffed from the mileage/one way field in the primary division of the division mileage multiple.  It is changed whenever the one-way 
                                mileage in the primary division is changed.

                                the 'C' cross reference, and a correct look-up for the mileage will rely solely  on the correct spelling of the city/town.
