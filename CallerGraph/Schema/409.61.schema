              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the name of the list.  
                                 
                                The list name should be namespaced and unique.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The "B" cross reference of this field is used by the List Manager when it is called by the application. For example, the application would call the List Manager as follows: 
                                 
                                D EN^VALM("SDAM APPOINTMENT MANAGEMENT") 
                                 
                                The value passed in the actual list is used to find the LIST TEMPLATE entry.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 31, 1992 
              DESCRIPTION:       This field indicates the type of list.  
                                 
                                 A 'protocol' list will cause the List Manager to 
                                 use the PROTOCOL entered in the 'PROTOCOL MENU' 
                                 field.  
                                 
                                 A 'display' list will use the standard VALM DISPLAY protocol 
                                 supplied by the List Manager.  This protocol allows 
                                 user to view or scroll though the list.  The user 
                                 will be able to use the standard 'next screen', 
                                 'previous screen',etc. actions.  
                                 
                                 A 'select' list is similar to the 'display' list but 
                                 will also allow the user to 'select' entries.  The 
                                 application will then use the selected entries in its 
                                 processing  This type of list is not currently available.

                                If set to 'NO', then lists will be presented in scrolling mode. For some actions, like 'up one entry', this would increase use of system resources.  
                                 
                                If set to 'YES', then list will be presented using the terminal type's capabilities.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The List Manager will store this field's data in the following local variable:

              LAST EDITED:      MAY 29, 1992 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 4, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates the number of actions a user can select at one time.  
                                 
                                For example, if this parameter is set to 1 then the user can only enter one action...  
                                    Select Action: NX 
                                 
                                ...and the following would not be allowed: 
                                    Select Action: NX,EP 
                                 
                                If this parameter is not entered then the system defaults to 1.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field could be very important to an application.  If an action causes a change in the list's entries then following actions could be affected. The user may think that an entry number corresponds to a certain entry,
                                when in fact the list and the numbering may have been changed.  
                                 
                                 
                                Setting the parameter to 1 is the safest and is the default if the field is blank.

                                This parameter is only used if the application calls the List Manager's date range selection utility.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The List Manager will store this field's data in the following global variable:

                                If set to 'NO', a default will not be provided automatically. It will be the developer's responsibility to indicate a default, if desired.  This default can be indicated by setting XQORM("B") as part of the protocol menu's
                                HEADER code. (i.e. D SHOW^VALM S XQORM("B")="Your action")

                                However, as discussed above, the developer can override this default by setting XQORM("B").

                                  allows the developer to indicate the list's identification fields for user readability.
