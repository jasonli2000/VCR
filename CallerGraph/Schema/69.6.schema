Lab Orders Pending file serves as a temporary storage locations for electronic laboratory test orders. LEDI software populates and manages the contents of this file.  
 
Electronic test orders from VA collecting sites are stored in this file until ordered test results have been returned. Electronic orders are matched with physically shipped specimen during accessioning process.  Specimen processing status update
information is also stored in this file to assist in the management of workload.  
 
When the results have been stored in the collecting site's patient clinical record, entries will be purged from this file.  
 
NOTE: The user should not directly edit this file via FileMan. Appropriate options are provided to manage the data in this file.
