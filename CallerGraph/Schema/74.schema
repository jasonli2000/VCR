This file contains the reports for registered exams.  These reports are usually first dictated by the interpreting physician before being entered by the transcriptionist.  
 
The Radiology/Nuclear Medicine software includes an HL7 interface to support report entry using voice recognition systems.  
 
The data in this file has three basic sections: 
 
         I. Demographic information about the file 
                - patient, date reported, date entered etc.  
        II. Text Data 
                - clinical history, report and impression 
       III. Computed Fields that obtain data from patient's exam record 
                - technician, procedure etc.  
 
The computed fields can be a very efficent way to do File Man prints and searches of exam record data, as opposed to doing prints and searches through the 'RAD/NUC MED PATIENT' file.  
 
 Data Storage 
 ------------
The data for the 'RAD/NUC MED REPORTS file is stored in the ^RARPT( global. This global is very volatile and should be journaled.  It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.  
 
Because of the large amount of disk space the report text will demand of the system, the module has a 'Purge Data' function that will allow the site manager to delete the 'REPORT TEXT' and 'CLINCIAL HISTORY' fields on a periodic basis. It is up to the
computer site manager and the imaging coordinator to determine how long this data will remain on-line. The 'IMPRESSION' text will not be purged.  
 
In the future, the module will also have an archive function.  
 
 Input Templates 
 ---------------
The following is a list of input templates used by the package and the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template: 
 
                   Compiled 
 Name              Routine    Description; Option(s) 
 ----              --------   ----------------------
 RA REPORT EDIT    ^RACTWR*   Used to enter/edit reports and associated 
                              information into this file; 
                              RA RPTENTRY 
 
 RA VERIFY         ^RACTVR*   Used to indicate a report has been verified; 
 REPORT ONLY                  RA BATCHVERIFY, RA RPTVERIFY 
 
 RA PRE-VERIFY REPORT EDIT    Used to edit reports and associated 
                              information in this file. Does not allow 
                              report verification; RA RESIDENT PRE-VERIFY 
 
 RA PRE-VERIFY REPORT ONLY    Used to pre-verify reports; 
                              RA RESIDENT PRE-VERIFY 
 
If any modifications to these input templates are needed for local purposes, then great care should be taken not to degrade any branching logic in the template.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains a value to indicate the status of this report.  Valid choices are: 'V' for Verified, 'R' for Released/Not Verified, 'PD' for Problem Draft, 'D' for Draft, 'EF' for Electronically Filed and 'X' for 
                                Deleted.  
                                 
                                'V' (Verified) status refers to a report that is verified by the interpreting physician and is available for display outside the Rad/Nuc Med Department to appropriate users, such as ward clerks, nurses, and physicians.  
                                 
                                'R' (Released/Not Verified) status refers to a report that is not verified by the interpreting physician and is available for display outside the Rad/Nuc Med Department.  The 'R' status is allowed only when the parameter
                                that controls this feature, 'Allow Released/Unverified' of the 'RAD/NUC MED DIVISION' file (#79), is set to 'Yes'.  Use the 'Display Report' option to view reports with the 'R' status.  
                                 
                                'D' (Draft) status or 'PD' (Problem Draft) status refers to a report that is available only for display in the Rad/Nuc Med Department.  A statement describing the problem to the interpreting physician is printed at the end
                                of reports with the 'PD' status.  
                                 
                                'EF' (Electronically Filed) status refers to a report that is interpreted outside the Rad/Nuc Med Department.  The content is not the actual interpreted report, but canned text referring to the outside interpreted report.  
                                 
                                'X' (Deleted) status refers to a report that is deleted from a case, but remains in the database though not selectable from any Radiology options.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:       The 'RAD/NUC MED REPORT UNVERIFIED' bulletin uses a variable called RASTATX.  This variable is one character in length.  Some of the codes are greater than one character in length, i.e, 'PD'.  In this case, the 
                                routine RAUTL9 must resolve variable RASTATX to its full internal format.  If sets of codes are added to the data dictionary which are longer than one character in length, then routine RAUTL9 should be modified to reflect
                                these changes if the new code is processed by this routine.  The new 'EF' added by patch RA*5*56 is not used by routine RAUTL9, so routine RAUTL9 does not have to be modified.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the report text for the imaging exam. The report text is written by the interpreting physician and may be entered into the system by a transcriptionist.  A report may also be entered into DHCP when the
                                interpreting physician uses a voice recognition system.  
                                 
                                If the interpreting physician requests a standard report, the information in this field is copied from the 'Report Text' field of the 'Standard Reports' file.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains the 'impression text' of the rad/nuc med exam associated with this report.  The 'impression text' gives a quick summary of the 'report text'.  It is written by the interpreting physician and is entered
                                into the system by the transcriptionist. The system will allow the interpreting physician to directly enter this information into the 'impression text' field through a voice recognition system.  
                                 
                                If the interpreting physician requests a standard report, the information in this field is copied from the 'impression text' field of the 'Standard Reports' file.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field may contain a patient's clinical history as well as instructions to the interpreting physician.  For example, the instructions might be for the physician to interpret the exam images to rule out the possibility
                                of the patient having a certain disease.  
                                 
                                The 'additional clinical history' is written by the interpreting physician and is entered into the system by the transcriptionist.  Voice Recognition systems allow the interpreting physician to directly enter this 
                                information into the 'additional clinical history' field.
