              HELP-PROMPT:      This is Standard MUMPS code. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field specifies the routine that this application runs to (re)process and exception.  The form is - 
                                 
                                    DO [TAG]^ROUTINE[(parameters)]

                                Note that the variable VFDXIEN is defined as the exception IEN to reprocess when the processing routine is called.  
                                 
                                The application processing routine should set the variable VFDOUT=1 to stop processing, i.e. to stop being called in a loop to process multiple exceptions.
