              DESCRIPTION:      Enter a picture clause specific to Paper Keyboard.  A picture clause describes the intended format for the data type.  This is similar to an M pattern match.  For example, a CPT code is 5 characters, the first character
                                may be an alpha or numeric followed by 4 numeric characaters.  To represent this picture in Paper Keyboard, one would enter the picture X####.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>120!($L(X)<1) X
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 28, 1995 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-120 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      When using print formats for paper keyboard you should enter the picture clause in this field.  For example, the print format for a SSN might look like ___-__-____.  This would cause the dashes to be printed and user input
                                to be accepted in three subfields with lenghts of 3, 2, and 4 numerics.  You would then enter the picture in this field as ###-##-####.  (note the # sign is used as the picture for numerics)
