This is the main file in the Control Point Activity package.  It contains information concerning each and every control point transaction.  There are four basic transaction types:  Ceiling, Obligation, Adjustment and Cancelled.  Each transaction type has
a set of fields in this file that relate to it.  Some fields relate to all four transaction types.  This file should only be edited through the Control Point Activity package.
