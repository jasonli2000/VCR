              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the SOP Class that was used to acquire an image. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a DICOM UID.  A unique identifier (UID) in DICOM is a string of up to 64 characters long that consists of only digits and periods.  
                                 
                                The UIDs that are stored in this file identify the SOP Classes that are being used for Image Acquisition.

                  Description:  The standard cross-reference truncates the value to 30 characters.  This version of the cross-reference uses all (up to 64) characters of the value.

              HELP-PROMPT:      If there is an equivalent SOP Class, enter its identification. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a pointer to another entry in this same table.  If the SOP Class that is described in the current record is equivalent to another one, the value of this field identifies this other SOP Class.  
                                 
                                If there is no equivalent SOP Class, this field is empty.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 14, 2005 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Indicate whether the current entry is Active or Retired. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The value of this field is a code that indicates whether the SOP Class that is described in the current entry is active or retired.  
                                 
                                Retired entries cannot be removed from this table (because they may still be "pointed to").
