This file shall be used to flag dispositions in the DISPOSITION (#37) file as either billable or non-billable for Means Test Billing.  The flagging of dispositions is date-sensitive, so the ability to not bill can be turned on or off.  The default
billing action is TO BILL ALL dispositions; thus, it is only necessary to add entries to this file if billing of a particular disposition is not desired.  
 
The routine IBEFUNC contains the function call to determine if a disposition should not be billed on a specific date.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
