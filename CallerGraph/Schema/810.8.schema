Counting groups are used for extract processing when the extract type is COMPLIANCE AND FINDING TOTALS. Each counting group defines reminder terms and type of counts to be totaled during an extract run. 
 
Counting groups are referenced and combined into one Extract Counting Rule in the REMINDER EXTRACT COUNTING RULE file (#810.7).  
 
The sequence number determines the order in which finding totals are saved to and displayed from the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY (#810.3) file.  
 
Nationally distributed counting groups are prefixed 'VA-' and cannot be modified by sites.  
 
Sites should name locally created counting groups according to their local naming convention.

              DESCRIPTION:      Count is used to specify the different ways the extract can count findings: 
                                 
                                MRF (Most Recent Finding count) counts the most recent occurrence of each  term in the group. This is also the default if no extract finding is  selected and all reminder terms are counted.  
                                 
                                MRFP (Most Recent Finding for Patient) counts only the most recent finding across the group. One count is accumulated for the one finding in the group of findings that is the most recent finding for each patient. 
                                 
                                UR (Utilization in Reporting period) counts all occurrences of findings from  the group that were documented during the reporting period.

                DESCRIPTION:      This is a pointer to the Reminder Term file. The reminder terms are used to identify patient findings that will be used to accumulate counts.  If the MRF or MRFP Count Type is defined with the Counting Group, then the
                                  findings (reminder terms) from the reminder evaluation are used to accumulate counts. If the UR Count Type is defined with the Counting Group, then the reminder terms are evaluated individually to find all findings
                                  documented during the reporting period.
