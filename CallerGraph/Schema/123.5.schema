This file allows services and specialties to be grouped in a hierarchy representing the sites services available.  This grouping capability may be used with Review screens to filter out consults to a service, sub-service, specialty, or sub-specialty of
consults/requests.  
  
The main entry in this file is the "ALL SERVICES" entry.  Other entries should be subordinate in its hierarchy.  
 
The "ALL SERVICES" entry is used to display the hierarchy of the hospital services when the Clinician ordering a consult is prompted for "Select TO Service/Specialty:" to send the consult to.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter '1' if the service is Grouper Only, 2 if the service is to be used for TRACKING Only, and 9 to DISABLE the service. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Whenever a value is defined in the SERVICE USAGE field, the Service entry will NOT be selectable to send consults TO in the OE/RR ordering process.  
                                  
                                Service Usages cause functioning as follows: GROUPER ONLY - Allows a service to be used for grouping other services together for review purposes, and aids in defining the service hierarchy (e.g., ALL SERVICES, INPATIENT
                                SERVICES, OUTSIDE SERVICES).  During the order process, a user selecting a grouper only service will be shown the service hierarchy under that service grouper.  A Grouper ONLY service should never be a "TO" Service on a
                                consult.  
                                  
                                TRACKING ONLY - Allows a service to be defined in a hierarchy, but will not allow users ordering consults in OE/RR to be able to see or select a service marked for TRACKING ONLY.  (e.g., Psychology may be defined with its
                                Service Usage blank, and its Sub-specialty multiple defined with services of which some or all may be "TRACKING ONLY" services.  This hierarchy facilitates the situation when a service, such as Psychology, prefers a common
                                location for all related consults to be sent to. A Tracking user at the common location then "Forwards" the request to one of the sub-service TRACKING ONLY services for completion.) 
                                 
                                DISABLED - Disabled services are not selectable for ordering or tracking.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  If the SERVICE USAGE value is changed to GROUPER ONLY or DISABLED and the service is defined in RELATED SERVICES to a PROCEDURE in file #123.3, then the PROCEDURES containing the SERVICE in RELATED SERVICES are displayed
                                to the user.

                                  There is no limit on how deep the hierarchy of services may be defined.  The only requirements are the "ALL SERVICES" entry be at the top of the hierarchy and a service can not be a sub-service to itself or any other 
                                  sub-service hierarchy which can be traced back to itself as a parent service.  

                TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                  This file is similar to the Option File and Protocol File.  The same concepts for setting up options should be used to define the Service/ Specialty entries.

                                The "GMRCACTM USER REVIEW SCREEN" protocol menu of actions will be used for all users as a default.  This default menu of actions contains inquiry only kinds of actions.  
                                 
                                Sites that are using the Medicine Package to enter procedure results may specify GMRCACTM MEDICINE PKG MENU as the Protocol Action Menu By Option field and the GMRC MEDICINE PKG INTERFACE option as the Security Update 
                                Optifor field.  This should only be specified on those services that are linked to a "GMRCR " protocol via the FILE LINK field in the Protocol File.  The exported Medicine sub-services are already defined for use with the

123.5,123.09  SERVICE PRINTER        123;9 POINTER TO DEVICE FILE (#3.5)

              LAST EDITED:      JUL 16, 1991 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the name of the Service/Section's Printing Device, or the nearest Printer. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field allows the service/specialty to identify a device that will be used for printing Consult Forms (513) 'automatically' at the service when the consult/request order is released by CPRS.  
                                  
                                If the device is not defined, the Consult Form will print at the location where the order was placed, bypassing the electronic relay functionality.  The order text in CPRS for an order to a service with no device is 
                                prefixed with ">>."  This indicates to the ordering clerks/clinician that the consult form needs manual processing or a call to the service to have the service use the "PS" action to print the service copy.

                DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to associate consult request service to clinics.  
                                   
                                  If the stopcode attached to the REQUEST SERVICE is the same as the stop code of the clinic profiles into which a procedure of the parent service would be scheduled, then both consults and procedures would display for the
                                  clerk to make a link at the time the appointment was made.  However, if the stopcode of the REQUEST SERVICE is different than the stop code of the clinic into which the procedure is scheduled, it would be necessary to 
                                  put both stopcodes into the REQUEST SERVICE to allow both consults and procedure requests to display for scheduling clerks.  
                                   
                                  The stop code of the chosen clinic during the scheduling process is compared to the stop codes of any consult which could be linked to the appointment.  If there is a match, and the current status of the consult meets
                                  the criteria listed below, the clerk will be presented with the following query: 
                                                  "Will this appointment be for a CONSULT/ PROCEDURE? NO//" This query allows the scheduling clerk to first display, and then link, the appointment to the consult.
