This file encodes actions which occur in connection with clinical narrative documents.  
 
These actions are referenced by entries in the User Authorization/Subscription file to associate users with actions.  
 
This file contains 2 kinds of actions: those a user is authorized to perform on a document, and those a user subscribes to for a document.  For example, a user is authorized to perform the Signature action, but a user subscribes to ("signs up to
receive") a Notification action.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                These are names of events which occur in connection with clinical narrative documents.  These are referenced by the User Authorization/Subscription file to associate users with events.

                                Action NAMES are checked when evaluating permissions in CANDO^TIULP. In addition, action NAME: ATTACH ID ENTRY is checked in input template USR DEFINE AUTHORIZATIONS when action ATTACH ID ENTRY is entered.  
                                 
                                These areas (and possibly other new areas) MUST be updated if the NAME of an action is changed.

              DESCRIPTION:      This file contains two types of events: those a user is AUTHORIZED to perform and those a user SUBSCRIBES to.  For example, a user is authorized to perform the Signature event, but a user subscribes to ("signs up to 
                                receive") a Notification event.  This field helps to define the meaning of an event and its relationship to a user.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Example: In "You cannot SIGN this unsigned document", the user verb is "SIGN".  Uppercase, 3-50 characters. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This word or phrase is displayed in explanatory messages when the user is denied authority to perform the given action.  Such a message might read, "You cannot SIGN this unsigned progress note", where the USER VERB is 
                                "SIGN".  
                                 
                                The USER VERB must make grammatical sense inserted in a sentence of the form: "You cannot [     ] this unsigned progress note."

              LAST EDITED:      FEB 15, 2000 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Example: In "An unsigned progress note can BE SIGNED by an author/dictator", the document verb is "BE SIGNED". Uppercase,3-40 characters. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This word or phrase is used in business rule options when displaying an authorization in sentence form.  
                                     
                                A business rule might read: "An unsigned Progress Note can BE SIGNED by an author/dictator." The DOCUMENT VERB in this rule is "BE SIGNED".  
                                 
                                The DOCUMENT VERB must make grammatical sense inserted in a sentence of the form: "An unsigned progress note can [      ] by an author/dictator."

8930.8,.07    USER VERB MODIFIER     0;7 FREE TEXT

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>30!($L(X)<3) X
              LAST EDITED:      JUN 14, 2001 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Example: In "You cannot LINK this unsigned note with a request", the user verb modifier is "with a request".  Lowercase, 3-30 characters. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Sometimes, in writing messages to the user denying a permission, the action must be split into two parts.  In such cases, the USER VERB MODIFIER is the second part.  
                                 
                                Example: In "You cannot LINK this UNSIGNED PROGRESS NOTE with a request", the USER VERB is "LINK", and the USER VERB MODIFIER is "with a request".  
                                 
                                The USER VERB MODIFIER must make grammatical sense when inserted in: 
                                     "You cannot LINK this UNSIGNED PROGRESS NOTE [    ]." 
                                 
                                Please use lowercase, 3-30 characters.  
                                 
                                If an action has an IDENTIFYING PHRASE or a USER VERB MODIFIER, the business rule ADD or EDIT action presents the user with a clarifying note about the rule they are creating immediately after the user enters an action.

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>50!($L(X)<3) X
              LAST EDITED:      JUN 01, 2000 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a phrase to help the user distinguish this action from others. 3-50 characters. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is NOT required.  It is available for use in helping users identify the correct action when writing business rules.  It appears when selecting actions from a list.  
                                 
                                For examples, see actions ATTACH TO ID NOTE, and ATTACH ID ENTRY.  
                                 
                                If an action has an IDENTIFYING PHRASE or a USER VERB MODIFIER, the business rule ADD or EDIT action presents the user with a clarifying note about the rule they are creating immediately after the user enters an action.

              LAST EDITED:      OCT 11, 1994 
              DESCRIPTION:      Some events imply other events.  For example, the ability to Sign a document implies the ability to View the document.  Thus, View is an implied event for the Signature event.  
                                 
                                Authorization/Subscription file, the user will be shown implied events for the given event and asked if they wish to include implied events for the current entry.  If so, a copy of the current entry will be created for
                                each implied event.

8930.8,2      DESCRIPTION            2;0   WORD-PROCESSING #8930.82

              DESCRIPTION:       The event description will be used in conjunction with the Authorization/Subscription field to define what it means to associate users with the event.  In most cases, this event description will suffice to determine the 
                                meaning of User Authorization/Subscription file entries.  
                                 
                                In rare cases, further description of what an event means when associated with users, document type and document status will be made in the description field of the User Authorization/Subscription file.  For example, a
                                signature event associated with documents of status completed means a walkup signature.  
                                 
                                This information will be used by persons creating entries in the User Authorization/Subscription file and by persons assigning users to user classes, when checking what events those user classes are associated with.
