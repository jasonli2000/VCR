              DESCRIPTION:      The INITIAL DIAGNOSIS VALUES field contains a list of valid diagnoses for this particular disease (as they are defined in the CDC form), separated by semicolons. Each initial diagnosis should consist of internal and
                                external values separated by colon.

                                The full set of possible diagnoses should be also defined for the INITIAL DIAGNOSIS field of the AIDS INDICATOR DISEASE multiple of the ROR ICR STUDY file.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                The value of this field is used by the input transform of the INITIAL DIAGNOSIS field (.02) of the AIDS INDICATOR DISEASE multiple (10) of the ROR ICR STUDY file (#799.4).
