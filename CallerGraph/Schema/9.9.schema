This file contains VistA patch information which is stored by a server option when a patch arrives to G.PATCHES at a site.  The server extracts certain information and stores it here.  
 
A night-time program will then check the file, match it against the install file.  If the current date is past the compliance date for patch installation (typically 30 days for regular patches, three days for emergency patches) it will do one of two
things: 
 
        1.  If the patch has been installed since last run and the parameter file is set in field 3 to delete installed patches, it will delete the entry from this file, regardless of the number of days in field 2.  If the parameter file is set to leave
patches, it is not deleted.  
 
        2.  If the patch has NOT been installed, its information will be saved and reported via a mail message to a group.  
 
The person(s) who are in charge of monitoring patches at the site or perhaps for the VISN will be responsible for following up on delinquent patches.

              DESCRIPTION:      The installation information may or may not be in the INSTALL file for a patch.  This may be because of: 
                                 
                                        a.  The package is new and may not yet be loaded

              LAST EDITED:      JUN 14, 2007 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a computed field, driven by a mumps routine XTPMKPCF.  This is a special routine to calculate the date installed from the INSTALL file.  It reads the index backwards to find the last installed version by taking the
                                $O(^XPD(9.7,"B",[INSTALL NAME],9999999999),-1).  
                                 
                                This is done because there may be several test versions on file in INSTALL file which may affect the true installation date determination.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter 1 if a Non-KIDS patch. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field determines what happens in various areas of the package.  A patch can be KIDs or non-KIDs.  The data on a patch record can be either NULL (KIDs patch) or 1 (Non-KIDs patch).  The field can actually be only set
                                to a 1 or the information deleted (NULL).

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the date this NON-KIDS patch was completed. 
              DESCRIPTION:      Non-KIDs patches are those which do not have an accompanying KIDs install in the Packman message because: 
                                 
                                        o  It may have an accompanying host file (too large for a mail 
                                           message) or 
                                 
                                        o  It may be a patch message referring to a .zip, .exe or other 
                                           file which will not put an entry into the INSTALL file.  
                                 
                                Because of this, there is no install record to extract the install date and it must be entered (i.e., completed) by filling in this field.
