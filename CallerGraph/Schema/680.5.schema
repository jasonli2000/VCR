              DESCRIPTION:      The title is the full title of a specific serial publication.  Such titles can be extremely long and the initial words in two different titles can be exactly the same for a considerable length, for example: 
                                   SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE 
                                   SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE.  SUPPLEMENTUM Since exact alphabetization of these titles is very important in the serials process, it is crucial that the field length be long enough to
                                accommodate all possibilities.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 19, 1988 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field provides for the prediction pattern which has been assigned in the National Library Files Maintenance option on FORUM for a serials title which is still being published.  No local input in the local Serials
                                Module is allowed for this field.  If there is no value in this field, there is no prediction pattern for this title, and thus there will be no automatic prediction of the next expected issue in the CHE option on the local
                                module.  Certain issuing patterns by publishers do not lend themselves to the establishment of a prediction pattern, most notably those quarterly publications which are labeled with seasonal designations such as spring, 
                                winter, etc.  In order for a prediction pattern to be created, the serials title must be dated in a MM/YY or MM/DD/YY format.

                                may have a frequency assigned; however, not every serials title may have a prediction pattern.  If no prediction pattern can be assigned, the frequency field may have the following type of value:  QUARTERLY, NO PREDICT.
                                PATTERN.  Old serials which are no longer published may not have a frequency entered.
