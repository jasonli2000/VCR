This file describes the TASKMAN's main file of jobs to start.  Because TM works on this file from many UCI's it doesn't use FM to manipulate it.  At this point there are no X-refs on this file and there are no fields that can be edited, Use TM options
for that.  The file can be searched, sorted and printed.  The third piece of the zero node is only updated when the XUTM QCLEAN option runs.  There are some applications that still do there own setting into this global and wipeout the zero node.  The
storage of the symbol table is not in a FM compatable format.
