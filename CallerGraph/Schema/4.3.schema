              DESCRIPTION:      This field holds the name of the domain which is considered the parent of this domain.  The parent domain's subordinate domain list will contain this domain, also.  
                                 
                                Parent domains are used for routing messages when a subordinate domain does not know a direct path to the selected domain.  
                                 
                                Domains are connected to their parents as follows: 
                                 
                                1.  The local domain is named.  2.  The parent is named at the local site.  3.  A script from the parent to the subordinate domain is created.  4.  A christening operation is performed by the parent domain.  
                                    When the subordinate domain is christened, the domain is connected 
                                    to the network.  (Mail may be addressed to remote domains)

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 2 and 5, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used by the unreferenced messages purge to avoid purging the last few days worth of messages in the message file.  It should be a number sufficiently high so as to avoid purging messages which are in danger
                                of being purged before they can be delivered.  This includes incoming network mail messages.  The minimum (and default if this field is null) is two days.  
                                 
                                For example, if this field is 2, then messages up to and including those whose local create date is 2 days ago are subject to possible purge.  


4.3,4.302     PURGE AUDIT            .1;0 DATE Multiple #4.302

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 23, 1998 
              DESCRIPTION:      This multiple contains a history of Message file purges.  Generally, a record of the last 20 purges is kept.  
                                 
                                MailMan has two ways to purge messages.  The option XMAUTOPURGE is generally run after XMCLEAN (the waste basket cleaner) and will purge any messages that are not pointed at by any recipients nor the sender.  The option 
                                XMPURGE-BY-DATE can also be run to purge messages that have an origination date older than one used to initiate the process.  It is recommended that before XMPURGE-BY-DATE is used, users be notified of the proposed purge 
                                date so they have a chance to preserve important texts.  These are the only options that actually kill off entries in the message file.  The XMPURGE option does the same thing as XMAUTOPURGE, but is meant to be run in 
                                foreground and displays data as it proceeds.  
                                 
                                Unlike XMPURGE and XMAUTOPURGE, which only remove messages that no one holds in their mail baskets any more, XMPURGE-BY-DATE will remove messages from users' mail baskets and then delete them from the message file (3.9).

                                  During unreferenced message purges, unreferenced messages are purged if they were created on or before the purge end date.  However, messages which originated locally and were sent to remote sites are not purged if they
                                  were created on or after this date.  This is to give the remote sites some time to reply to the unreferenced message.

                                baskets so that they will be unreferenced when XMAUTOPURGE comes along.  XMAUTOPURGE kicks off the part of XMUTCHECKFILE that checks the Mail Box file.  XMUTCHECKFILE also resets and cleans up the  x-refs of this file.  If
                                your system has had fairly clean runs of XMUTCHECKFILE or if the entire XMUTCHECKFILE process is run regularly as a separate process, it is not necessary for XMAUTOPURGE to run any part of it again.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  If this field is set to nill or other value that can be evaluated to zero (+field=zero), then XMUTCHECKFIL is called to check MailBoxes and recreate the X-ref that the XMAUTOPURGE uses to verify that a message is no longer 
                                referenced by anyone.  If it is set to 1, then this call to XMUTCHECKFIL is skipped.

              LAST EDITED:      SEP 17, 1998 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 30 and 999, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      When the unreferenced messages purge runs, it purges messages from the message file, ^XMB(3.9, which are no longer referenced, meaning they aren't in anyone's mailbox.  
                                 
                                If this field is null, OR if the purge is run on Saturday, the purge starts at the beginning of the message file. 
                                 
                                If this field has a value, AND the purge is run on Sunday through Friday, the purge starts at the message create date calculated by subtracting the number of days from today's date.  
                                 
                                So, if this number is 45, the unreferenced message purge would start with messages created 45 days ago, and work from there forward.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Are users required to enter introductory text about themselves to the MailMan system? 
              DESCRIPTION:      If this is turned on, then users must introduce themselves when they first log in to MailMan.  This forces users to describe themselves, and enter their phone numbers and addresses for others to query with the HELP options
                                in MailMan.

              LAST EDITED:      APR 24, 2002 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 50 and 10000, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      During message addressing, when a user addresses a message to a mail group with a lot of members, it can seem to take forever to process the group.  (Dots of death!)  This field, BIG GROUP SIZE, can help.  
                                 
                                IF you enter a number in this field, AND 
                                    - If the group contains member groups 
                                 or - If the group contains distribution lists 
                                 or - If the number of local members plus the number of remote members exceeds or equals the BIG GROUP SIZE boundary 
                                 
                                THEN the user is asked whether s/he wants to queue the group for later delivery, and avoid waiting while the group is processed.  
                                 
                                The user is also warned that if s/he chooses to queue delivery, then recipients may not be 'minus'ed from the group.  
                                 
                                If the user chooses not to queue delivery, then processing proceeds in the foreground, as usual.  
                                 
                                If the user chooses to queue delivery, then s/he is asked when the delivery should take place.  The group is then queued for processing and delivery at the specified time (by the same background job which 'news' messages).  
                                 
                                There is no default.  (If BIG GROUP SIZE equates to zero, then groups are processed in the foreground as usual.) 


4.3,7.3       SHOW DUZ WHEN ADDRESS MESSAGE 0;8 SET

                                '0' FOR NO;

              LAST EDITED:      APR 24, 2002 
              DESCRIPTION:      When someone addresses a message to a local user, should the DUZ of the local user be displayed? 
                                 
                                (If this field is null, the default answer is "no".) 
                                 
                                Disadvantages: 
                                 - Your site's DUZs may be SSNs.  They should not be displayed.  
                                 - Users may be confused by the display.  
                                 
                                Advantages: 
                                 - A DUZ is unique, whereas some users may share the same or very similar name.  If a user knows the addressee's DUZ, the DUZ may be used to address a message, instead of the name.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Should the user's address be displayed in a MailMan lookup? 
              DESCRIPTION:      Option XMHELPUSER displays user information.  Among the items displayed are the address fields (.111 through .116) from the NEW PERSON file.  
                                 
                                Some sites have home address information in these fields, which should not be displayed.  
                                 
                                If the address fields should be displayed, answer YES; otherwise, answer NO.  If this field is null, the default answer is NO.

                                "DSM" and does not contain "VAX".  This is because of a situation that exists where DSM for PDP-aa series used to use on $ZCALL anbd in the updated version uses a slightly different one.  Both do not exist in one system.  
                                The way it is inserted is by setting an error trap and then trying one.  If it doesn't work, it must be the onther.

                                 - DNS IP (field 51 in file 8989.3) must contain an IP address for a DNS server.  
                                 - Routine ^XLFNSLK must exist.

                                If you answer 'yes', MailMan will use the IP addresses in the domain scripts, but if they fail, or don't exist, MailMan will use DNS to ascertain other IP addresses to try.  MailMan will replace failed script IP address 
                                with the successful DNS IP address.

                                This is the maximum number of characters to read at a time when receiving incoming transmissions.  Default is 255.  
                                 
                                Limiting factors are: 
                                 - Maximum string length on the system.  
                                 - Maximum global length on the system.  In particular, maximum (desirable) length of a line of message text in the MESSAGE file: 
                                   S ^XMB(3.9,xmz,2,x,0)=<line of message text> 
                                 
                                You may also wish to consider the maximum string length that the system's various editors can handle.  See the Technical Description for more information.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  Why would you want to set the block size higher than 255, which has been the historical setting?  Just how long a line do you need for the text in a message?  Well, for user-to-user communication, 255 is more than enough. 
                                But for application-to-application communication, 255 may not be enough.  512 may be.  So, if your system can handle globals with 512 characters, setting this field to 512 is recommended.  
                                  
                                How can you tell how long a string a global can be set to?  Do this at the programmer prompt: 
                                 
                                 > S ^TMP("XM",$J)="" F I=1:1 S ^TMP("XM",$J)=^TMP("XM",$J)_"X" 
                                 > W $L(^TMP("XM",$J)) <--- This is your answer 
                                 > K ^TMP("XM",$J) 
                                 
                                Yes, some systems can handle way more than 512, but we need to limit the maximum, so that if we need to port data from one system to another, any system can handle data from any other system.  
                                 
                                There is one caution.  It's a small one, but you should be aware of it.  Your system's text editors, which are used to edit message text in MailMan messages, may not be able to handle line lengths of more than 245 or 255. 
                                When does this become a problem?  Only if you attempt to copy and edit messages which have such lengthy lines.  Such lines may be truncated by the editors.  This is not really much of a problem, because you probably won't
                                be copying and editing such messages, since they would most likely contain application-to-application communication.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Background filer hangs up to 99 seconds between mail deliveries (default=5). 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used by the background filer when it is started up to determine the amount of time it will hang between deliveries of messages.  Since mail is not delivered, even to the sender, unless the backgournd filer
                                delivers it, it should not be too long a period so that your users are inconvenienced.  If this field is not filled in the background filer will hang for 5 seconds between deliveries.  5 to 15 seconds is the recommended
                                range.

              LAST EDITED:      JAN 23, 1992 
              DESCRIPTION:      The background filer checks this field every time it is about to deliver a message or response.  If it is set to 1, it stops running, and will not restart until it is set to null or zero.  If it is null or zero, and is
                                already running, it continues.  If it is null or zero, and is not running, a background task will be created to restart it.

              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field enables site management to limit the number of lines which may be printed to P-MESSAGE.  If this field is null, there is no limit.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 7 and 14, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to control the size of the message number in ^XMB(3.9, the MESSAGE file.  If this field is null, its default will be 8 digits.  If the message number becomes greater than this many digits, the message
                                numbers will recycle back to the next vacant message number after 999999.  In this way, message numbers will cease being too ungainly in size.  
                                 
                                So message numbers will be re-used.  
                                 
                                If MailMan is not able to find a vacant message number less than this number of digits, then MailMan will take the next available message number, no matter how many digits it has, AND MailMan will change this field to
                                reflect the new maximum.  
                                 
                                It is very important that the unreferenced messages purge and/or the date purge be run on a regular basis to free up message numbers for re-use.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Let users forward priority messages to mail groups? 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter YES if you wish to allow users to forward priority messages to mail groups.  
                                 
                                Enter NO if you don't.  (This is the default, if this field is null.) Then only the message originator or anyone with the XM GROUP PRIORITY key may forward priority messages to mail groups.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The issue here is one of annoyance.  Priority messages can be annoying.  When priority messages are inappropriately forwarded to mail groups, the annoyance quotient rises dramatically.  If you wish to have MailMan be the
                                enforcer, then set this field to NO.  (Then only a select few users will be able to forward priority messages to mail groups.) If you wish to have the user's peers be the enforcers, then set this field to YES.  (Then
                                anyone can forward priority messages to mail groups, and users who inappropriately do so, risk the wrath and flames of the annoyed recipients.)

              LAST EDITED:      JUN 06, 2000 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Let users drop out of non-self-enrolling mail groups? 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter YES if you wish to allow users to drop out of non-self-enrolling mail groups.  The user will be warned that this is a non-self-enrolling group, and that they won't be allowed to rejoin later, and then they will be
                                asked to re-confirm the decision to drop out.  
                                 
                                Enter NO if you don't.  (This is the default if this field is null.) Then users will have to contact IRM or the mail group coordinator to ask to be dropped.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  If a mail group is not a self-enrolling mail group, then users can't just join.  They must be added by the mail group coordinator.  
                                 
                                If a user no longer wishes to be a member of such a group, he must ask the group coordinator to drop him.  But what if the group coordinator has left the organization or is unresponsive?  Then what?  Then the user will
                                have to ask IRM to help.  This problem can be avoided by setting this field to YES.  
                                 
                                Some would argue that the coordinator added the user to the group for a reason, and the user should not be allowed to drop out.  (Perhaps the coordinator is the user's boss.)  They would argue that it is MailMan's job to
                                prevent the user from dropping out.  (Set the field to NO.) Others would argue that it is not MailMan's job at all, but the boss's job to prevent the user from dropping out, and to discipline the user if he does.  (Set the
                                field to YES.)

                                Enter 'S' if the user's title should come from field 20.3, SIGNATURE BLOCK TITLE.  If that field is empty, then we'll try field 8, TITLE.  
                                 
                                Enter 'T' if the user's title should come from field 8, TITLE.  If that field is empty, we won't show any title.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Should message relaying be prevented? 
              DESCRIPTION:      Answer YES if you want to prevent outside sites from sending mail through your site to other outside sites.  Spammers and Virus propagators use this technique to disguise the source of their mail, and to make it appear to 
                                come from a trusted source, namely your site.  
                                 
                                Answer NO if you want your site to act as a relay site for anyone.  
                                 
                                It is strongly recommended that you answer YES to prevent your site from unwittingly relaying destructive mail.  
                                 
                                If you answer YES, you should define your "inside" sites in the MY DOMAIN (field #41) multiple, so that MailMan can distinguish them from outside sites.  
                                 
                                Note: This does NOT prevent users from receiving mail from outside sites.  It also does NOT prevent users from forwarding mail to outside sites.  Such actions are perfectly acceptable.

                DESCRIPTION:      If you answered YES to PREVENT MESSAGE RELAYING? (field #40), to stop your site from relaying messages from outside sites through your site to other outside sites, you may add entries here, in order to define what is an
                                  "inside" site, or sites whose messages your site is willing to relay.  
                                   
                                  For example, if your site is a VA site, then other VA sites are "inside" sites, and your site should relay mail for them.  So, any site whose domain name ends in ".VA.GOV" is an "inside" site.  So VA sites should have
                                  only one record in this multiple, and it should be ".VA.GOV".  
                                   
                                  The default, if there are no entries in this multiple, is your site's domain name.  
                                   
                                  MailMan will check the site name of any site which connects to it, and identifies itself in the SMTP HELO <sitename> command.  If the sitename ends in any of the entries in this multiple, then any mail coming from that
                                  site through your site to other sites, will be accepted and relayed onward.  
                                   
                                  If the sitename does not end in any of the entries in this multiple, then messages will only be accepted that are addressed to recipients whose sitenames end in one of the entries in this multiple.  Otherwise, the site 
                                  will receive an error message telling it that relaying is denied, and messages will not be accepted for relaying onward.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Select a limited broadcast default 
              DESCRIPTION:      When sending a limited broadcast message, this is the default which will appear when the user is presented with limited broadcast choices. 
                                 
                                If you don't want a default to appear, delete this entry.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  For this field, we are simulating a pointer to a record in the LIMITED BROADCAST multiple.  The executable help displays the choices in the multiple.  The input transform makes sure you choose one of the choices.  The
                                output transform converts the "pointer" to the limited broadcast name.

4.3,142       NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (LOCAL) .14;2 NUMBER

              INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>10)!(X<2)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
              LAST EDITED:      SEP 18, 1998 
              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 2 and 10, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used during the un-referenced-messages purge to avoid purging the last few messages in the message file, according to their local create date. 
                                 
                                We subtract the NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (LOCAL) from today's date, giving a 'no-purge date'.  Local messages which were created on or after that date and which were sent to remote sites are not subject to purge.  Other
                                messages are not affected by this buffer.  
                                 
                                If this field is not filled in, it defaults to 7 days.  This is the recommended value.  
                                 
                                It should not be less than the NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (field 4.301) or it will have no effect.  
                                 
                                One situation in which this buffer may be useful is in the case of a message sent only to a remote site.  Such a message is unreferenced and would otherwise be subject to purge.  If a reply came from the remote site after
                                the original message had been purged, the sender would have access only to the reply and not to the original message.  The NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (LOCAL) could be set to a reasonable number of days to allow for a reply.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Is your site fax enabled? 
              DESCRIPTION:      Your site is fax enabled if you have the suite of fax software and files (^AKF) and fax capability and you choose to allow faxes to be sent via MailMan.  
                                 
                                To send faxes via MailMan, Mail groups (file 3.8) must first be populated in the fax recipient and fax group multiples.  Then, when a user sends a message to a mail group, the message is also faxed to any fax recipients in
                                that mail group.  Responses to the message are not faxed.
