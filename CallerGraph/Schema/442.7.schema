This file contains a listing of pre-set clauses used on purchase order.  The file is initially sent with data, but each station can then edit or add their own clauses.  Once a clause is entered to this file, the Purchasing or PPM agent can then copy the
clause into any Purchase Order or Requisition, which will cause it to be printed in the P.O.  Comments block on the P.O. or Requisition form.
