              DESCRIPTION:      The name of the developer's routine which is run at the beginning of the install process.  This should just check the environment and should not alter any data, since the user has no way to exit out of the install process
                                until this program runs to completion.  This routine can interact with the user. If the variable XPDQUIT is set, the install process will terminate.
