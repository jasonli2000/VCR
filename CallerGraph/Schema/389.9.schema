The purpose of this file is to allow DHCP software flexibility and reliability when the station number of a medical center changes or when one or more stations have merged into one station.  
 
Adding or modifing entries in this file may affect many DHCP applications.  Control of entry into this file should be carefully controlled by the IRM Service Chief.

              DESCRIPTION:      Each station has one primary divison.  This normally is the divison where the station number is 3 numberic characters with no suffix.  If this is the primary division then this field should be set to 'YES'.
