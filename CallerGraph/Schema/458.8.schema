The Recess Tracking file contains records of recess periods for each fiscal year for nurses on the 9-month AWS schedule.  Nurses on the 9-month AWS shall be required to schedule 75 percent of the fiscal year as work and 25% of the fiscal year as recess,
prior to beginning the AWS.  The periods of work and recess are prorated from the first pay period in which the AWS begins and the last pay period of the fiscal year.  An ETA fiscal year runs from the first full pay period after September 30 through the 
following year and the entire pay period that contains September 30.

              DESCRIPTION:      This is the fiscal year during which the 9-month AWS is effective.  The fiscal year for 2006 (FY06, sometimes written FY05-06) is from October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006.  However, the fiscal year for purposes of
                                the 9-month AWS will be governed also by complete pay periods, since the nurses normal hours=80 and duty basis = part-time, must be in effect for the entire pay period. Thus some 9-month AWS fiscal years may have 50, 52 or
                                54 weeks.  The fiscal year is defined as the 12 months from the first full pay period after October 1 through the full pay period that contains September 30.  In the example, September 30, 2007 is the first day of pay
                                period 20 and thus the entire pay period is included in the weeks for the 9-month AWS schedule for FY07.  The last pay period--weeks 53 and 54--are also part of the fiscal year for the AWS since September 30 is in that pay
                                period.
