This file is used to log errors that occur in the DHCP Server side of AICS.  
 
Currently this occurs while rolling up the data from the scanner in a format that is then passed to the PCE Device Interface.  Under normal circumstances very few errors should occur, however, if they do occur, the workstation software (client side) will
be notified and the error can be found in this file and if possible resolved.  Normally each error represents one piece of data that was ignored by the server software and can easily be entered into PCE using one of the data entry methodologies.  
 
Entries in this file may be deleted after any corrective action that needs to be taken is complete.
