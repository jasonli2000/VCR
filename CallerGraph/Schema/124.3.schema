                                First it sets a multi-field ("AA") index on the Audit Trail sub-file with the Audit Trail Date/Time (.01) and Modificatino (1) sub-fields of the Audit Trail sub-file.  The structure of this cross-reference is: 
                                  ^GMR(124.3,DA(2),1,DA(1),2,"AA",9999999-Audit_Trail_D/T,Modification,DA)="".  
                                 
                                Secondly, this cross-reference sets part of the ("ALIST") index on the Selection sub-file.  This index represents the order in which the terms were selected for this entry.  This index takes the value of the Selection 
                                (.01) sub-field of the Selection sub-file associated with this Audit Trail entry and checks to see if this modification is an add or delete.  If it's an add, then it will update the "ALIST" cross-reference to indicate that 
                                this Selection is currently part of the data.  This includes ensuring the "ALIST" index exists for this Selection, and that any parents of the Selection present in the "ALIST" index have their child list updated to 
                                indicate that this Selection is a child for its parent.  If it's a delete, then it updates the "ALIST" cross-reference to indicate that this Selection is not part of the data by removing the "ALIST" entry for the Selection
                                and removes this Selection from its parent's children lists. The structure of the index is: 
                                  ^GMR(124.3,DA(1),1,"ALIST",Selection,#)="^child1^child2^..." where # is an integer ranging from 1 to the number of entries in the index for the particular Selection.  The cross-reference is equal to an ^ delimited list
                                of the children selected for the particular entry being indexed.  If the list of children is longer than 245 characters, it overflows to the next # subscript.
