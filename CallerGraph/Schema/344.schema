This file holds batch payments information.  Payments no longer are posted directly to patient bills, but rather, entered into this file.  Once the entries in this file are reconciled with cash on-hand and verified to be correct, they are then 'posted'
to the patient bills.

                                  bills the patient has remaining.  If the bill is not a patient bill, then the money will be applied to the specific bill and any money left over will be refunded.

                DESCRIPTION:      Once payments begin to post to bills, this field will reflect the amount of payment actually processed.  For example, if the payment amount is $20.00 and only $15.00 of the payment could be applied, this field would
                                  reflect the $15.00 processed.

                DESCRIPTION:      Date of Payment represents the date the payment was received and should be credited to the account.  For example, if the payment was received yesterday, but due to time-delays is being input today, this field should be
                                  set to T-1 (yesterday).  This is necessary so the patient will get credit for paying bills on time.  If the patients' payment date was, for example, 5/10/92 and the payment was received 5/9/92 but is being input on
                                  5/12/92, this field should have 5/9/92.  If 5/12/92 is entered, the patient will be incorrectly charged interest and administrative charges.
