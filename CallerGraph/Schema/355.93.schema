                                  Only one code can be the primary taxonomy code for a provider.  When a specific taxonomy code is identified as the primary code then that code will be the default taxonomy code.

                DESCRIPTION:      If a taxonomy code listed for a provider is a currently active code (one they use today), then the status should be marked with an 'A'.  At times a provider will no longer use a taxonomy code.  This code will be marked 
                                  with an 'I' for inactive.  Codes should not be removed from a provider's list.  They should be either active or inactive.
