              DESCRIPTION:      This field provides for the frequency of issue which has been assigned in the National Library Files Maintenance option on FORUM.  No local input in the local Serials Module is allowed for this field.  Every serials title
                                may have a frequency assigned; however, not every serials title may have a prediction pattern.  If no prediction pattern can be assigned, the frequency field may have the following type of value:  QUARTERLY, NO PREDICT.
                                PATTERN.  Old serials which are not longer published may not have a frequency entered.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field provides for the prediction pattern which has been assigned in the National Library Files Maintenance option on FORUM for a serials title which is still being published.  No local input in the local Serials
                                Module is allowed for this field.  If there is no value in this field, there is no prediction pattern for this title, and thus there will be no automatic prediction of the next expected issue in the CHE option on the local
                                module.  Certain issuing patterns by publishers do not lend themselves to the establishment of a prediction pattern, most notably those quarterly publications which are labeled with seasonal designations such as spring, 
                                winter, etc.  In order for a prediction pattern to be created, the serials title must be dated in a MM/YY or MM/DD/YY format.

                                the form of A1111, to identify and place the prediction pattern in a coherent scheme of patterns.  The alpha characters identify the underlying frequency, such as A- monthly, K- 8 times per year, etc.  The numbers place
                                the prediction pattern in the proper sequence within its frequency type according to months, days, number of volumes, etc., according to a predetermined format for the PREDICTION PATTERN NAME.
