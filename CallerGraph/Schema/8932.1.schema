This file holds the CMS (HCFA) provider type data.  
 
In 2001, ANSI ASC X12N asked the National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC) to become the official maintainer of the Health Care Provider Taxonomy List (provider type).  
 
PERSON CLASS is to be used for identifying provider types for roll-ups.  
 
Patches need to review the technical description on field 90002.

                                 There are approximately 800 Provider Taxonomy codes and they are all 10 digits in length. The hierarchy of provider categories incorporates four areas of provider classifications that, when used in concert with one 
                                another, create the capability to sort providers into broad and specific categories.  There are four levels in the hierarchy including: 
                                 
                                 I. Provider Type - 2 byte alphanumeric: 
                                 A code that identifies a major grouping of service(s) or occupation(s) of health care providers.  
                                 
                                 II. Classification Code - 2 byte alphanumeric: 
                                 A code that identifies more specific services(s) or occupation(s) within the health care provider type. The coding is based on licensed provider classifications.  
                                 
                                 III. Area of Specialization - 5 byte alphanumeric: 
                                 A code that identifies the provider's specialization, a segment of the population that a health care provider chooses to service, a specific medical service, a specialization in treating a specific disease, or any other
                                descriptive characteristic about the providers practice relating to the services rendered.  
                                 
                                 IV. A place holder for future expansion - 1 byte alphanumeric

              LAST EDITED:      JUL 08, 2003 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates whether the entry is for an Individual or for a Non-Individual, and was added at the request of IHS in their namespace, until the file supporting Non-Individuals can be defined.  
                                 
                                Note that the current definition of the X12 CODE does not explicitly indicate whether an entry is for an Individual or for a Non-Individual, either in value or structure definition.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is in the IHS numberspace, and is for their use pending development and deployment of a file to support a Non-Individual taxonomy.  
                                 
                                PERSON CLASS is intended for Individuals, and as of this writing, plans are under way to create a separate file to support that portion of the X12 Provider Taxonomy which is for Non-Individuals.  
                                 
                                August 30, 2002.  
                                 
                                IHS has added entries for non-Individuals to the file.  Patches should take that in to account when planning how to load new data.
