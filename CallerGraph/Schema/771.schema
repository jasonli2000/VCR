              HELP-PROMPT:      The HL7 field separator used by the DHCP application.  If this field is not filled in, the uparrow (^) character is defaulted to as the field separator.  Answer must be 1 character in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The field separator separates two adjacent fields within a segment.  It also separates the segment ID from the first data field in the segment.  The field separator can be defined differently for each HL7 message.  The 
                                fourth character in the MSH segment serves as the field separator for all segments in the HL7 message.  
                                 
                                If this field is left blank, the default will be the '^' character.  However, most messaging applications use the '|' as a field separator.| 
                                 
                                Note that the character used as a field separator CANNOT be reused as one of the HL7 ENCODING CHARACTERS. If you choose the default '^' as a field separator then choose the default encoding characters as well (~|\&). If
                                you choose the vertical bar as a field separator, then simply| replace the vertical bar in the encoding characters with the '^', i.e., ~^\&. Due to Fileman limitations, the '^' cannot be the first character in the encoding
                                character string.

              HELP-PROMPT:      The HL7 encoding characters used by the DHCP application.  If this field is not filled in, the characters ~|\& are used as the default encoding characters.  Answer must be 1-4 characters in length. 
              DESCRIPTION:      If this field is left blank, the default encoding characters will be set to, "~|\&". Note that if you choose this default, the FIELD SEPARATOR must| be set to "^". If you choose the vertical bar ("|") as a field
                                separator,| enter "~^\&" as your encoding characters. This will avoid a potential conflict with VA Fileman.  
                                 
                                Up to four encoding characters may be defined. Each encoding character must be unique and none of the encoding characters may be the same as the field separator character. Each encoding character serves a specific purpose.  
                                 
                                The first encoding character is the component separator.  Some data fields may be divided into multiple components.  The component separator is used to separate adjacent components within a data field.  
                                 
                                The second encoding character is the repetition separator.  Some data fields may be repeated multiple times in a segment.  The repetition separator character is used to separate multiple occurrences of a field.  
                                 
                                The third encoding character is the escape character.  Data fields defined as text or formatted text may include escape sequences.  The escape character is used to separate escape sequences from the actual text.  
                                 
                                The fourth encoding character is the sub-component separator.  Some data fields may be divided into components, and each component may be further divided into sub-components. The sub-component separator is used to separate
                                adjacent sub-components within a component of a field.  
                                 
                                Note that the character used as a field separator CANNOT be reused as one of the HL7 ENCODING CHARACTERS. If you choose the default '^' as a field separator then choose the default encoding characters as well (~|\&). If
                                you choose the vertical bar as a field separator, then simply| replace the vertical bar in the encoding characters with the '^', i.e., ~^\&. Due to Fileman limitations, the '^' cannot be the first character in the encoding
                                character string.
