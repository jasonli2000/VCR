This file contains a list of all Query (QRY~R02) HL7 transmissions that have been generated at the site by the Patient Record Flags software module.  Entries in this file are created/edited automatically by the Patient Record Flags HL7 interface.  
     
Records in this file should not be added or edited except through the use of the Patient Record Flag software that is part of Registration. Doing so would likely cause Patient Record Flag database corruption.
