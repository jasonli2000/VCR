Per VHA Directive 2005-044, this file has been "locked down" by Data Standardization (DS). The file definition (i.e. data dictionary) shall not be modified. All additions, changes and deletions to entries in the file shall be done by Enterprise Reference
Terminology (ERT) using the Master File Server (MFS), provided by Common Services (CS). Creating and/or editing locally defined fields in the file are not permitted. Use of locally defined fields that were created prior to VHA Directive 2005-044 shall
not be supported.  
 
This file contains the VA Drug Classifications. Each five-character alpha-numeric code specifies a broad classification and a specific type of product. The first two characters are letters and form the mnemonic for the major classification (e.g., AM for
antimicrobials).  Characters 3 through 5 are numbers and form the basis for subclassification.  The VA Drug Classification system classifies drug products, not generic ingredients. Drug products with local effects are classified by route of
administration (e.g., dermatological, ophthalmic). If a product is not classified by route of administration, it is classified in most instances under a specific chemical or pharmacological classification (e.g., beta-blockers, cephalosporins). If a
product is not classified by route of administration, or chemical or pharmacological subclassification, it may be classified under a therapeutic category (e.g., antilipemic agents, antiparkinson agents).
