This file holds the site parameters for this installation of the Kernel.  It will have only one entry -- the domain name of the installation site.  Some parameters are defined by the systems manager during the installation process.  These include Agence,
volume set multiple, Default parameters.  Others may be edited subsequent to installation. Spooling, response time, and audit parameters may be established.  Priorities may be set for interactive users and for TaskMan.  Defaults for fields such as timed 
read, auto menu, and ask device are defined for use when not otherwise specified for a user or device.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field holds the value for how long a CCOW token is good for in seconds. When the current time is greater that the CCOW token create time plus the timeout seconds, the CCOW token will no longer be valid. If this value
                                is too small (short) users will be frustrated that the SSO part doesn't work.  If the value is too large (Long) there is a chance that it could be used to break into the system.  A default value of 5400 (1.5 hours) will be
                                used.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field controls how long the Broker server waits (in seconds) for some activity from the client. Its value is passed to client applications compiled with version 1.1*6 and above of the Broker. The client application
                                will contact ("poll") the server at an interval based on this field's value to let the server know it is still there. If a client stops polling the server, the server knows that the client process has terminated. The
                                "ghost" server job is therefore stopped, enabling locks and other resources to be freed. A small timeout value in this field creates more server and network activity. A large value leaves ghost jobs on the server longer. 
                                We recommend setting it to a value of 180 seconds as a good compromise.
