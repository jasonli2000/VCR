Entries in this file define standard inventories by defining the areas of use and type of inventory items inventoried.  This saves the user from having to re-define the inventory boundaries every time a particular inventory is scheduled.  Instead, the
user can name inventory groups and the computer then knows what will be inventoried by accessing this file.

              DESCRIPTION:      This group name represents the Areas of Use which are inventoried together as a "batch" or "cluster".  This grouping establishes the elements of the inventory so that they do not have to be redefined every time the
                                inventory is scheduled.  Inventory groups may be established by (1) location, (2) time, (3) category or "type" of item to be inventoried, or any combination of these three.
