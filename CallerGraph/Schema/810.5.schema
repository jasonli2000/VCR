Patient lists in this file are created from the Reminder Due reporting option, Reminder Patient List option or from Reminder Extract runs. Reminder patient lists are retained for 5 years in this file before being purged. Individual patient lists can have
the automatic purge turned off.  
 
 
Patient lists that are created from national extract runs are prefixed with "VA-". 
 
Sites should name locally created patient lists according to their local naming conventions.
