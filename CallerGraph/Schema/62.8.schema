              DESCRIPTION:      If orders are being sent to a non-VA facility and the facility can not accept VA test order codes then answer with the type of coding system.  "NON-VA" indicates that the other system is using a local coding system.  The
                                laboratory shipping software will then use the non-VA test codes entered for each test on this configuration.  
                                 
                                If the non-VA facility can accept VA test codes then answer "NLT" and the software will sent VA test order codes.  
                                 
                                VA test order codes are usually NLT codes but in the future will probably be LOINC codes. Selecting "LOINC" is currently not supported. Support will be added in a future version of the LEDI software when LOINC coding has 
                                been implemented within VA facilities.
