                                Then the boilerplate for a document entered using template DEMOGRAPHICS with BLANK LINES = 1 would look like: 
                                 
                                  Patient Name:

              LAST EDITED:      AUG 23, 2001 
              DESCRIPTION:      The TIU TEMPLATE FILE stores templates for use in composing documents and also stores the containers which organize the templates into trees. Every entry in the file belongs to at least one tree.  Some entries contain 
                                other entries as items.  
                                 
                                There are 5 types of entries in the TIU TEMPLATE FILE: 
                                      'T' for TEMPLATE 
                                      'G' for GROUP TEMPLATE 
                                      'C' for CONTAINER 
                                      'P' for PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER 
                                      'R' for SHARED ROOT CONTAINER 
                                      'TF' for TITLE ROOT FOLDER 
                                      'CF' for CONSULT ROOT FOLDER 
                                      'OF' for PROCEDURE ROOT FOLDER 
                                 
                                The first two types, T and G, are true templates and may be selected for composing documents.  
                                 
                                The remaining types are "containers" which hold templates as items.  The purpose of the container types is to organize templates according to subject matter into trees, so that individual templates can be easily found as
                                "leaves" of a tree.  Container types are NOT used for composing documents.  
                                 
                                Besides holding templates, containers may hold other containers, which then function as subcontainers.  
                                 
                                The last five types, P, R, TF, CF, and OF, are containers of a special type, denoted "roots".  A root functions as the single top level of its tree.  Each site has a "shared" root container, which contains templates shared
                                across the whole facility.  Each user at a site has a "personal" root container, which contains the user's personal templates.  Thus, each user at a site has access to two trees: the shared tree, and their own personal
                                tree.  The Title, Consult and Procedure root folders are special folders that allow templates to be linked to specific TIU Titles, Consult Reasons for Request, and Procedure Reasons for Request.  
                                 
                                Root containers (like all container types) hold templates of type T and G, and may also hold subcontainers (type C).  
                                 
                                                             TYPE DETAILS 
                                 'T': A TEMPLATE is the most basic piece of boilerplate text desired.  It may be used by itself for composing documents, or it may be added as an item to a Group Template, becoming part of a larger template.  
                                 
                                 'G': A GROUP TEMPLATE  is a composite of its item TEMPLATES.  In addition to the boilerplate text of its items, it may also have its own boilerplate text. A GROUP TEMPLATE may also have items of type CONTAINER (C).  These 
                                items are for storage only; they are ignored when the GROUP TEMPLATE is used to compose a document.  
                                 
                                 'C': A CLASS CONTAINER is a container for templates. In addition to templates, it may also contain other containers (C), which then function as subcontainers.  
                                 
                                 'P': A PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER functions as the root (top level) of a user's personal template tree. A PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER may contain both shared and personal entries.  
                                 
                                When adding shared entries to their personal trees, users need to be aware that changes made at the facility level to a shared template will carry over to their personal tree. Changes a user makes to a shared entry in 
                                their personal tree do NOT, however, carry over to the shared tree.  Instead, when a user goes to edit a shared item under his/her PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER, that item is copied, and the user made the PERSONAL OWNER of the
                                copy. The original shared item remains the same in the shared tree.  
                                 
                                 'R': A SHARED ROOT CONTAINER is shared across a site.  Templates contained in it may be selected by any user composing a document, but the user may not edit the template itself. Besides its use for documents, a site's
                                shared tree functions as a repository from which users can add templates to their own personal tree.  
                                 
                                 'TF': The TITLE ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific TIU Titles.  Although end users will not see this folder directly, they will see templates appear automatically when the associated TIU Title is selected.  
                                 
                                 'CF': The CONSULT ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific Consult Reasons for Request.  End users will not see this folder directly, but they will see templates appear automatically when ordering a consult, and the 
                                associated Consult service is selected.  
                                 
                                 'OF': The PROCEDURE ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific Procedure Reasons for Request.  End users will not see this folder directly, but they will see templates appear automatically when ordering a procedure, and the
                                associated procedure is selected.

              LAST EDITED:      MAY 26, 1999 
              DESCRIPTION:      Entries in the TIU TEMPLATE FILE have status ACTIVE or INACTIVE. Status INACTIVE serves as a way to hide entries from users composing documents.  
                                 
                                INACTIVE templates are NOT available for composing documents. In theory, ACTIVE templates ARE available.  In fact, however, even an ACTIVE template's select ability depends on its position in the tree, as will be seen
                                below.  
                                 
                                Containers, for their part, may also have status ACTIVE or INACTIVE, and may contain ACTIVE or INACTIVE items.  Thus, an INACTIVE container may contain ACTIVE templates.  However, an INACTIVE container and all its items
                                (whatever status) are hidden from the user composing documents and are thus not selectable.  
                                 
                                Although users are permitted to have more than one Personal Root Container, only one per user is allowed to be ACTIVE at a given time.  Similarly, a site can have only one ACTIVE Shared Root Container at a given time.  
                                 
                                If an entry is no longer desired for either storage or for composing documents, it can be deleted.  However, once the last occurrence of it as an item in any tree is deleted, it is deleted from the file itself and cannot
                                be retrieved.  Therefore, users are encouraged to INACTIVATE entries rather than delete them unless they are sure they won't want them back in the future.

              DESCRIPTION:      Applies only to templates (types T and G). There are occasions when a template is added as an item to some Group Template simply as a logical storage place, and not because the template is usually desired as part of the

              DESCRIPTION:      The PERSONAL OWNER of an entry is a user from the NEW PERSON FILE who can edit the template or container.  An entry is recognized by the computer as personal (as opposed to shared) by the presence of a PERSONAL OWNER.  
                                PERSONAL OWNER is set automatically when a user goes to edit a shared entry in their personal tree: the shared entry is copied, and the user is made the owner of the copy.

                                A container (type C, P, or R) holds templates (TEMPLATES and GROUP TEMPLATES) as its items. It may also hold other containers as items.  
                                 
                                A GROUP TEMPLATE is made up of TEMPLATES or of other GROUP TEMPLATES as items.  Its boilerplate text is a composite consisting of, first, it own boilerplate text if it has any, and then the boilerplate text of its items,
                                in SEQUENCE order.  (See also field EXCLUDE FROM GROUP BOILERPLATE.)  A GROUP TEMPLATE may also have a container (type C) as an item.  In this case, the container is simply being stored in the GROUP TEMPLATE; the container
                                is ignored when the GROUP TEMPLATE is used for composing a document.  
                                 
                                A TEMPLATE (type T) does not have items.  
                                 
                                A given template or container may occur as an item in more than one tree, and may even occur more than once in the same tree.  It cannot, however, be an item under itself.  Nor can it occur twice, as an item of the same 
                                parent.  
                                 
                                An item may be deleted (after a warning) from a tree by its Personal Owner (for personal trees) or by a member of the Editor Class (for shared trees).  If this instance is the only remaining occurrence of the entry in any
                                tree, it is then deleted not only as an item, but also as an entry in the TIU TEMPLATE FILE and cannot be retrieved.
