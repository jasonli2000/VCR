                DESCRIPTION:
                                  This comment will be displayed if this list becomes the active list in the CAPRI GUI.  This is not the comment for the division, but only pertains to the specific list being accessed.

                LAST EDITED:      SEP 04, 2002 
                DESCRIPTION:

                LAST EDITED:      SEP 04, 2002 
                DESCRIPTION:      If there is a specific institution that this list applies to (e.g. ST.PETERSBURG-RO), then enter the name.  The list will be displayed to the user if their assigned division matches this entry and they've selected the
                                  division under which this list is being created.  
                                   
                                  This will allow the site, for example, to create a separate list for Veterans Benefits, Board of Veterans Appeals, Tiger Team, etc.  In some cases, an exam of one type may be done at a division for BVA but not VBA.
