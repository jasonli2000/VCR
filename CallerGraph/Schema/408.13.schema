              DESCRIPTION:      Answer with the individual's social security number.  Answer must be 9 numbers in length. The SSN will be sent to the SSA for verification. This status will be displayed next to the SSN.  Once an SSN has received a status
                                of Verified, it is locked from user updating and a "VERIFIED" will be displayed by the SSN field.  Only HEC staff are able to change a Spouse or Dependents verified SSN.  If SSA indicates the SSN is invalid, "INVALID" will
                                appear next to the invalid SSN of the individual. Facilities should make every effort to obtain the accurate SSN from the individual for any invalid or pseudo SSN.
