This file is populated with post processing actions for each image type.  The file has a multiple 'TYPE' field that points to the file IMAGE INDEX FOR TYPES which allows the possibility of multiplempost processing for each entry in this file.  
 
When an Image is successfully captured an evaluation is done on the image's TYPE property.  If the TYPE matches an entry's TYPE field value in this file and the entry is ACTIVE, then execution is passed to the routine identified in the fields: TAG and
ROUTINE.
