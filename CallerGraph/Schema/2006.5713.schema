The entries in this table describe images that could not be processed because the DICOM Gateway had no information about the "modality" that generated the image.  
 
"Modalities" are defined in table 2006.582 (MODALITY TYPE DICTIONARY), which is populated from the text-file xx:\DICOM\DICT\MODALITY.DIC.  
 
The "C" cross-reference on this table organizes the problem-images by the identifying properties of the "modality": manufacturer, model, and modality-type.
