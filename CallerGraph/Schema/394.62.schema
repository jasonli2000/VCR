This file holds any patient information that was transmitted using PDX.  
 
 
If field # .05 is set to 'YES', fields # .03, .04, 10, 20, and 30 will not contain data (field # 50 will contain the display ready format of the segment).  
 
If field # .05 is set to 'NO', field # 50 will not contain data (fields # .03, .04, 10, 20, and 30 will contain the information required to rebuild the Extraction Array).  
 
Segments stored as display ready will only have one entry.
