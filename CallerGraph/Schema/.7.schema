This file stores operating system-specific code.  Since the code to invoke some operating system utilities that FileMan uses varies among operating systems, code to perform these utilities is stored in and executed from this file.  During the FileMan
INIT process an operating system is selected so that FileMan knows which entry to use from this file.
