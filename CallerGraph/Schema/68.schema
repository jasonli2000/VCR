 This file contains entries which represent the functional subdivisions or departments of the laboratory, referred to by the Laboratory package software as accession areas.  The file is used to define the site-specific information needed by your
laboratory for each accession area.  This includes the type of accession transform (or how often the accession numbers assigned to test performed in that area will be reset to 1), the abbreviation of the area (which becomes part of the accession
identifying the specimen and test results), the order in which the data for tests performed in the area will be displayed and other specific information.  
 
Definitions of variables used:

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a 1-2 character code using the digits 1-9 and/or the letters A-Z (uppercase only). 
              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to build the unique accession identifier number.  It is used as the first two characters of the number.  Use the numbers 1-9 and uppercase letters A-Z to designate the identifier. For example, if you
                                enter 99 all accession identifiers for this accession area will start with 99, e.g. 9923400025.  
                                 
                                If a single character is used the system will append a leading zero to the unique identifier generated.  
                                 
                                No two accession areas can use the same identifier.  
                                 
                                Changing the identifier should only be performed when accessioning is not occurring and when a situation requires it since personnel will memorize this identifier as representing the accesson area.  
                                 
                                Do NOT switch identifiers between active accession areas since this could compromise the uniqueness of the resulting unique identifier (UID). The software when generating a UID checks for the existence of the UID it will 
                                create for an accession. If it currently exists the UID being created will have "00" as the numeric identifier.

              DESCRIPTION:      Occassion Of Service (OOS) 
                                 
                                 This field is used for passing data to the PCE API. This API is used to capture CPT codes for laboratory procedures.  
                                 
                                Special OOS Hospital locations have been created that are solely used for recording workload (No count locations). These OOS location all begin with 'LAB DIV' in their names.  
                                 
                                Example of name: LAB DIV 600 OOS ID 108 Where 600 is the Station Number from the Institution file (#4).  Where 600 is the division Station Number where the work is done.  Where 108 is the OOS ID (stop code) for the service
                                doing the work.  
                                 
                                Note: The stop code could be one assigned to another service, ie Medicine.  Stop Codes are not limited to Laboratory 108.  
                                 
                                The Laboratory Information Manager has special options used to create new OOS locations in HOSPITAL LOCATION file. These options are used when and new division is established or a new stop code is required.  
                                 
                                The location names are constructed by the option and should not be altered using FileMan. The naming convention is critical to the ability to assign OOS Hospital Locations to Laboratory Accession (#68) file.  
                                 
                                If a given Accession Area in the Accession file (#68) does not have a LAB OOS LOCATION S LOCATION (#.8) Hospital Location assigned, the DEFAULT LAB OOS LOCATION (#.8) from the LABORATORY SITE (#69.9) file will be used.  If
                                the DEFAULT LAB OOS LOCATION field is not defined, no workload will be captured.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 15, 0 Decimal Digits 
              DESCRIPTION:      Enter the number of zeros ("0") to pad an accession number when printing a bar code using the accession number. Used when site needs a minimum length bar code on labels.  
                                 
                                Example if need a four digit bar code then enter four.  
                                        This would produce the following: 
                                        Accession number       Bar Code
