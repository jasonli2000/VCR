This file records changes made to a shipping manifest. It is used to track the "who, what, when..." of events that occur to a shipping manifest and the test specimens that are on the manifest. It will record when a shipping manifest is created, built,
closed and shipped. It will also record when test specimens are added, removed, shipped, received and completed. The user and the date/time of the event and entry are also recorded.
