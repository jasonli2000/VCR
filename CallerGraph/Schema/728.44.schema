This file holds the DSS translation tables for entries in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).  For each clinic, this file holds its name, stop code, credit stop code, and DSS alternatives for both stop code and credit stop code.  Also included is a field
indicating which code should be sent to the DSS commercial software, that is, stop code, credit stop code, or both.  If there is no data in this file for a given clinic, the stop code in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) will be used.  If DSS alternate
stop codes are entered, they will be used in place of those entered in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).  This file should be reviewed by the DSS manager on a regular basis and corrected as needed.  Since several fields in this file are linked to fields
in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44), data in this file should be entered and edited only by using the DSS software and not by direct access via VA FileMan.
