This file is used to maintain a record of audiological exams.  It contains all of the air conduction, bone conduction and word recognition test results.  
  
When signed (DATE SIGNED field), the results are transmitted to the Denver Distribution Center to be stored in a national database.  The information from the last exam received for a patient is also added to hearing aid orders for the patient placed
through the Remote Order Entry System(ROES3.0) at the DDC.  
  
Data for this file is only entered through the Audiometric Exam Module GUI application: ACKQROES3E.  Entering data in any other way, may have unpredictable results, as help for individual fields and most data validation takes place in that application.  
  
An accompanying GUI application: ACKQROES3 uses the data in this file to create a graphical audiogram.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  This field is filled in at the local clinics from the entry in the Audiometric Module GUI application.  The name from the local clinic is transmitted along with the hashed SSN to the DDC, where it is added to their file. 
                                If a match can be found in the DDC database this field will be filled in at the site, with that DFN.
