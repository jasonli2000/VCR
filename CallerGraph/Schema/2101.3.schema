              DESCRIPTION:      The batch number of the batch created.  Example: 460-VOL-89-75 would indicate a batch with station number 460, code sheet system identifier VOL (3 character identifier for batch type), fiscal year 89, and counter number
                                75.  The counter is generated from file 2101.5 GENERIC CODE SHEET COUNTER.
