This file is a translation table for converting free text lab test results into numeric codes for use by Decision Support System (DSS). The translation table is used to translate the RESULTS field (#10) of the LAB RESULTS EXTRACT file (#727.824) to a
standard numeric code to indicate the test result when text has been entered instead of a numeric value.  The translated value is used to populate the LAB RESULTS TRANSLATION field (#27) of the LAB RESULTS EXTRACT file (#727.824).  
 
This file has been populated initially with common free text values for lab test results that were compiled by the DSS Program Office.  Sites may add new entries to this file as needed with other free text values and their corresponding translation
codes.
