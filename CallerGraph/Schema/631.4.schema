                                      2  third staff member in discipline, etc.  All students in a particular discipline should share the same HBPC provider number (e.g.  all RN students would be 200).  New provider numbers are issued only when FTEE is
                                increased.  Provider number '190' can be used as a 'catch-all' category if the need arises.
