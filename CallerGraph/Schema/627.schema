              DESCRIPTION:      This field contains, in capital letters, the KEY words describing the diagnosis. The multiple keyword fragment lookup allows looking up that diagnosis by several keywords (including synonyms). For example, 'HEROIN' will
                                work as well as 'OPIATE' for looking up opiate dependency. One can look up this diagnosis by typing keyword fragments separated by blank spaces: e.g. 'HER DEP' or 'OPIA DEP'.
