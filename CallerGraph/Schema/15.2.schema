                                  This field contains the TAG for entry into the merge routine for the package.  This will generally be in the form of TAG^ROUTINE(ARRAY)

                DESCRIPTION:
                                  This is the name of the routine as specified in the package file under the 'Affects Merge' entry that specifies special processing for this package.

                HELP-PROMPT:      This value indicates the most recent date/time checkpoint of the active process. 
                DESCRIPTION:
                                  This value indicates the last date/time recorded as a checkpoint by the process.  This value is used to determine whether the process is still active or not.

                LAST EDITED:      APR 16, 1996 
                HELP-PROMPT:      This field is used to indicate which processing stage it currently is in. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to indicate which processing stage this merge process is currently in.  The merge process goes through three stages, but since the first is rapid and doesn't require any effort to repeat (since the
                                  entries have already been merged) only two stages are recorded.  The FASTER (or EARLY) stage indicates the processing of pointers which either DINUMmed or cross-referenced so that they can be identified rapidly.  The
                                  LATTER stage indicates the processing of pointers which can only be found by stepping through each entry within a file - these are the pointers which require longer periods to sucessfully complete the re-pointing.

                LAST EDITED:      APR 16, 1996 
                HELP-PROMPT:      This field indicates the current file being processed as indicated at the last checkpoint of the active merge process. 
                DESCRIPTION:
                                  This value indicates the file currently being processed as recorded at the last checkpoint by the active merge process.

                LAST EDITED:      APR 16, 1996 
                HELP-PROMPT:      This value indicates the most recent internal entry number as checkpointed within the FILE - CURRENT file by the active merge process. 
                DESCRIPTION:      This value indicates the last internal entry number recorded as a checkpoint (within the checkpointed file) by the active merge process.  This value (in conjunction with the other checkpoint data) is intended for use in
                                  tracking the progress of the merge process and, if necessary, to permit the merge process to be restarted in the vicinity where it was last processing.

                  HELP-PROMPT:      This is the file number for one file to be processed by this thread. 
                  DESCRIPTION:
                                    Entries in this sub-file are created during the merge processing when a new thread is created to assist in processing the third phase.  The values are removed upon completion of the processing.
