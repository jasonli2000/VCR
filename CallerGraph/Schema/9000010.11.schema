This file has been designed for joint use by the Indian Health Service and the Department of Veteran Affairs.  
 
This file contains immunizations specific to a particular visit for a particular patient.  This file contains one record for each immunization.  
 
In the VA, if a CPT code is entered into PCE that represents an immunization, than an immunization will automatically be entered in the V Immunization file.  And vice versa, if an immunization is entered into PCE that has a related CPT code, then a V CPT
entry will automatically be created with the CPT code for the immunization.  The PCE Code Mapping file contains the definitions of what immunization is related to what CPT code, and vice versa.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the date and time the immunization was given. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is the date and time the immunization was given.  This date and time may be different from the visit date and time.  For example, for clinic appointment visits, the visit date and time is the date and time of the 
                                appointment, not the time the provider performed the clinical event.  
                                 
                                The date may be an imprecise date.  
                                 
                                Date and time may be within 30 days before of after the visit date, with the restriction the date cannot be a future date.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE User Interface, which allows manual entry of data, will be the primary source of the immunization date and time.  The immunization date prompt defaults to the visit date and the time is entered to reflect the
                                actual time the immunization was given.  The immunization date does not have to be the visit date, but it must be within 30 days before or after the visit, and not be a future date.  
                                 
                                If the user wants to enter an historical immunization, the user should use the Historical Encounter entry action to document the historical immunization. Historical entries will not be eligible for credit.  
                                 
                                PCE data sources for automatic (scanning) data capture will be blank unless the immunization date and time are passed to PCE for filing.

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                PCE filing logic automatically compares the before and after pictures of the record to determine if the edited flag should be set to "1".

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer is automatically entered by the PCE filing logic. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                This field is populated automatically by the PCE filing logic.  The format of the field is as follows:  Pointer to PCE data source file_"-"_A for Add or E for Edit_" "_DUZ of the person who entred the data_";"...  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:  The PCE filing logic requires a pointer to the PCE data source file.  If this is not passed, the PCE filing logic will not process the data.  
                                 
                                If the record is a new record, then an "A" is used to specify the source that added the data.  If the record existed previously, PCE filing logic compares the old and new records of informtion.  An "E" will be
                                automatically used if the filing logic finds the data has been edited.  If "E" is used, then the Edited Flag field is automatically set to 1.  
                                 
                                The DUZ is stored in its internal format to represent the user who performed the adding or editing of data for this record.  
                                 
                                Iterations of editing will be concatenated to the previous data source value, up to 85 characters.
