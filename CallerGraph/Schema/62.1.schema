The DELTA CHECKS file contains entries whose use is optional.  They are entered in the LABORATORY TEST file (#60) under the site/specimen for the field 'Type of delta check'.  The field 'Delta value' may be used or need to have an entry depending on the
type of delta check.  If test results are being entered or reviewed for verification on a test that has an entry in the 'Type of delta check' field for that site/specimen then the code in the DELTA CHECK file is executed.  Usually the delta check is used
to prompt back to the technologist a warning that there is some inconsistency in the data, so that the data can be rechecked before it is verified.  Delta checks can be used for other reasons such as skipping over entries that do not need to be prompted
or for doing calulations on data and storing the calculated results.

              DESCRIPTION:      MUMPS code describing the delta check.  Example:  For the Delta Checks Name "ABS VALLUE" (absolute value) the Executable code is Q:X=""!(X1="")!(+X2=0) S Y=0,X3=X-X1 S:X3<0 X3=-X3 I X3>X2 S Y=1 W "  <<DELTA CHECK>> 
                                ",7,X3.  This statement ends the routine if the response is null (carriage return), if the previous value (X1) is null, or if the maximum difference is 0.  If not, the difference between current and previous value
                                (X3=X-X1) is computed and converted to the absolute value and the message "  <<DELTA CHECK>>  ", a bell, and the absolute value is printed.
