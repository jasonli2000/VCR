This is a reference file containing the types of health insurance claim forms used in billing.  
 
Sites may add local forms to this file however, the number of entries for locally added forms should be in the stations number range of Station number time 1000.  
 
If other than UB-04 forms are pointed to by the BILL/CLAIMS file, then the follow-up letter job will create a separate tasked job for each bill to the Follow-up Printer for that form using the specified routine for that form.  
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
