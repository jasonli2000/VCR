              HELP-PROMPT:      Select place. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This is a Place.  This maps the storage provider (with its Place) to a specific client Place. It essentially defines a logical network path.  Allows us to say, for example, that from Place A, you can only write to the
                                Archive storage provider in Place B between certain hours.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter date and time of end availability window. 
              DESCRIPTION:      The end time for the availability window.  If the end time is greater than the start time, it is taken to be a window in a single day. Example: Start time of 8PM, End time of 10 PM results in a two hour window each day
                                between 8PM and 10PM.  If the end time is less than the start time, it is taken to be a window that spans across midnight, encompassing two days.  Example: Start time of 10PM, End time of 2AM results in a four hour window,
                                starting at 10PM on the first day, and ending at 2AM on the next day.  
                                 
                                The date component of this field is ignored. VA FileMan doesn't support Time only data type.
