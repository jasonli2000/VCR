  This file is used to tailor the Inpatient Medications package with regards to specific users.  Some of these parameters (fields) can be set by the users, and others can only be set by an Inpatient supervisor.  (A supervisor is a user who has been
assigned the 'PSJU MGR' security key.) 
  This file also contains fields that are used as temporary storage of data during order entry/edit.

              DESCRIPTION:        Unless the user is a pharmacist, the user can be set up to allow Unit Dose orders to be entered by Orderable Item or Dispense Drug. If selection is by dispense drug the order's Orderable Item will be determined based on 
                                that dispense drug.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:    When entering new Unit Dose orders pharmacists select directly from the DRUG file (#50). The order's Orderable Item is determined from the Orderable Item assigned to the entry selected from the DRUG file (#50).  Users
                                who are not identified as pharmacists may only select from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) unless this field is set to 'YES'.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Is this user a Pharmacist, Nurse, Pharmacy Technician, or Ward Staff? 
              DESCRIPTION:        This is used to define what type of user this user is.  The type of user helps define what actions the user can or cannot take on Inpatient Medications orders.  If no entry is made here, the user is assumed to be WARD
                                STAFF.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                  This allows the supervisor to define what type of user the site's users are to the package.  This is only editable by the supervisor.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer 'YES' if verification can be automatic when this user enters orders. 
              DESCRIPTION:
                                  This is used to determine if the user can enter Unit Dose orders as ACTIVE, allowing the user to skip the extra step of manually verifying those orders entered by this user.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                  If this is set to 'YES' for a user that has been designated as a nurse or pharmacist, orders entered by this user will be transcribed as ACTIVE (by the routine PSGOETO).  This is editable only by the supervisor.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Answer 'YES' to have any labels created by your actions print on the printer designated for the ward instead of the printer designated for the pharmacy. 
              DESCRIPTION:        This allows the pharmacist (or pharmacy technician) that may be working on the ward(s) to use the label settings defined for the ward(s) instead of the label setting defined for the pharmacy.  
                                  PLEASE NOTE that if you have defined a LABEL PRINTER, that printer will always be used to print labels instead of either the ward or pharmacy label printer.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:    This allows pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to use the label settings defined for the ward(s) instead of those label setting defined for th pharmacy.  This is most useful when the pharmacist or tech is working
                                mostly on the wards.  This is editable by the user, but only those users designated as either a pharmacist or tech.  
                                  PLEASE NOTE that if the user has defined a LABEL PRINTER (field #7), that printer is always used instead of either the ward label printer or the pharmacy printer.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter how the Inpatient profile is to sort and show orders. 
              DESCRIPTION:        This is the sort order in which the Inpatient Profile will show inpatient orders.  Enter 'MEDICATION NAME' (or '0') to show the orders alphabetically by drug name.  Enter 'START DATE OF ORDER' (or '1') to show the orders
                                chronologically by start date, with the most recent dates showing first.  
                                  PLEASE NOTE - The profile will always first show orders by status (active, non-verified, and then non-active), and within status, schedule type (continuous, one-time, and then PRN).  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:    This allows the user to define the order in which Inpatient Medications orders are shown on an Inpatient profile.  This is also used by the Inpatient profile shown in the LABEL PRINT/REPRINT option.  This is editable by
                                the user.

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the type of Unit Dose order entry to be used by this user. 
              DESCRIPTION:        This is the type of order entry process to be used by this user.  The REGULAR order entry is the full set of prompts for the entry of an order, after which the user is shown a full view of the order and allowed to take 
                                immediate action on the order. The ABBREVIATED order entry gives the user fewer prompts for the entry of an order, after which the user is shown a full view of the order and is allowed to take immediate action on the
                                order.  The WARD order entry gives the user the same prompts as the ABBREVIATED order entry, but then gives a brief view of the entered order and does not allow immediate action to be taken on the order.  No entry here is
                                the same as selecting REGULAR order entry.  
                                 
                                  This does not affect the entering of Inpatient Medication orders through the Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR) package.  This is only for the entering of Unit Dose orders through the Unit Dose Order Entry option and 
                                the Inpatient Order Entry option.  

              TECHNICAL DESCR:
                                  This is used by the Unit Dose order entry functionality to determine the order entry process to be given each user.  This is referenced in the routines PSGOE0 and PSJOE0.  This does not affect OE/RR.

                HELP-PROMPT:    Enter a number between 0 and 30, no more than 4 decimals (will accept fractions). 
                DESCRIPTION:      This is the number of UNITS (tablets, capsules, etc.) to be dispensed as a DOSE for this order.  The literals '1/2' and '1/4' may be entered.  If there is no entry (or an entry of `0'), it is assumed to be ONE (1).  
                                                          ** PLEASE NOTE ** 
                                 1. If the provider prescribes 30 ml's of a medication that is usually dispensed and administered as 60 ml's, the correct UNITS PER DOSE would be `1/2' (or .5), NOT 30 ml's.  The correct entry of 30 ml's would be in the
                                DOSAGE ORDERED field.  
                                 2. If the UNITS PER DOSE prescribed is a variable amount (1-2 tab.), it is suggested that the maximum amount be entered and the actual amount prescribed noted either in the DOSAGE ORDERED or SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS fields.
